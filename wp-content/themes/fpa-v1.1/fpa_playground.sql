There is probably no quirkier or identifiable style of play than his.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstones of his game are brushing, scarecrows, rolls & gitis, all in large amounts. An interesting element to his game is he rarely uses fake fingernails like almost all other competitors do. \r\nHis win in Pairs at the 2002 FPA Worlds continues to solidify him as one of the greatest freestyle competitors of all time. Think about this: he''s tied for the most major titles with Joey Hudoklin. He''s won tournaments in 4 decades and Major''s in 3 decades. His list of partners reads like a "Who''s Who" on the all-time list. His influence is felt throughout the world due to his "Ambassador" status. When he hits a routine like the one in Boston 2002, it''s like another day in the office for the pride of the Chico Airheads." \r\n\r\nAccording to Laerbs: "...it was a revelation once I realized I couldn''t do all the moves others player could, because I couldn''t even touch my toes.

My partner, Judy Robbins, and I were the Women''s Pairs Champions at the FPA World Championships in Boston in 2002.  However my best tournament performance may have been a week later, when Judy and I won the Women''s division, and came in 5th in the Open division, at the World Masters Overall tournament in Worchester, MA.  My favorite routines have been my Mixed Pairs routine with Rodney, my husband (we took 2nd place in Mixed Pairs at the FPA World Championships in Italy in 2003), and my Women''s Pairs routine with Diane Marguilles at the U.S. Open in 1987 or 1988.\r\n\r\nI have also set three World Records in distance, including the one that got me into the Guinness Book of World Records: the Women''s distance record, set in 1987 (124.73 meters - 409 feet).\r\n\r\nHere''s the full story on how I started playing:  I lived in the dorms on campus during my first two years at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  My friends and I would play frisbee after our classes.  When winter came, we formed a college club so that we could use one of the schools gyms, and play inside.  We would divide up our gym time, starting out with freestyle, then play some Ultimate, and then Guts.  \r\n\r\nOur first national level tournament was an indoor "North American Series" (NAS) tournament in Ann Arbor, Michigan on my birthday (April 1).  Freestyle, distance (actually, it was "wall hitting") and guts were the events.  Jo Cahow was there, and she told us that she liked our club t-shirts.  We were so proud!  Later that summer, we went to NAS tournaments in Chicago and Minneapolis.  We practiced all the events, and entered them all too.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to San Diego in 1987, I found that most of my friends were freestylers, so I would go to the Cove, or to the beach, and play with them.  Soon, most of my disc play focused on freestyle and DDC.  My favorite jam spot memories are of the La Jolla Cove and the beach in Del Mar, both located in the San Diego area.  Close behind on that list are the La Jolla Shores beach and the beach and/or grass near the ''coaster in Mission Beach.  San Diego was also "the place to be" for DDC play.  We played each Thursday night, Saturday morning, and many Sundays.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s, I served on the board of directors of the Freestyle Players Association (FPA) - first as the Treasurer and then as the Director/President.  During that period, my San Diego friends and I coordinated several FPA organizational retreats and I oversaw the process of incorporating and obtaining the FPA''s tax-exempt, charitable status from the IRS. I coordinated most of the judging logistics at six FPA World Championships and co-directed the Summerfest Open Flying Disc Championships in 2000, 2001 and 2002.\r\n\r\nEven though I still consider myself an "overall" competitor and love MTA, Distance, and especially Double Disc Court (DDC) I find myself concentrating mostly on freestyle - and I certainly spend most of my frisbee time Jamming!', 20002, NULL, 'f', 0),

Those I have not jammed with I intend to.', 'From a friend...While sitting in the audience watching Paul freestyle, it''s not uncommon to hear comments such as, "What did he just do?" or "How many discs does he have now?" What are more intriguing about these commentaries are the people asking the questions. Typically, the interested audience members are other world-class freestylers themselves - and who seem to be the real audience for whom Kenny is playing.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, not many freestylers knew Kenny, although he has been playing disc since his college days in the late-1970s. When learning how to "jam," Kenny and his buddy attempted to learn trick moves without the benefit of ever seeing others at tournaments or on videotape. When the FPA Worlds was hosted in 1995 in Florida, Kenny appeared as a "new kid" with an under-the-leg tipping sequence that was a well-executed blur of hands, arms, legs, and disc. It was this "machine gun" move that became his trademark. But not for long.\r\n\r\nNearly 9 years later, there is hardly anyone in the freestyle community who does NOT know Kenny. He has frequented several Paganello (Italy) tournaments - which he has won a few times; the World Masters Overall; and hosts the annual Jammers Championship in his hometown of Jacksonville (Florida). Kenny is also regular fixture at the Arizona State Overall and FPA Worlds. In addition, he has been the Executive Director for the FPA for the past several years, showing the organization that he can apply a creative vision toward freestyle on and off the field.\r\n\r\nKenny''s growth in freestyle disc has not wavered, even with a lack of fellow-jammers living nearby. He is a regular at Jacksonville Beach (affectionately renamed as Mikondo Beach). It is here that Kenny (playing solo) switches from using his engineering expertise on his job and instead applies that expertise to a disc. The switch results in a technical application to freestyle moves that has pushed skill-limits far beyond status-quo: disc angles in the wind, a perfect whip-over to yet another set that is again turned-over, followed by an against move, and another turn-over-all with his non-dominant hand. Kenny can turn and twist a freestyle disc and a spectator''s mind simultaneously. \r\n\r\nBut it''s not just Kenny''s sheer dominance of a disc that is the culmination of his game. He dominates more discs than any other freestyler in history. Each year, he adds more discs to his routines, with last year''s total up to TEN. Just to clarify: in a routine, Kenny will catch the 10th disc in the same hand that is already holding nine discs.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, he won his first World title at an FPA Worlds event in the highly competitive division of Mixed Pairs, with partner Cindy Kruger.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his successes in pushing the limits of freestyle, his own playing style, and the FPA organization, Kenny exhibits humility and a clear vision of his goals. Best stated, he has a self-defined motto: F.R.I.S.B.E.E., Freestyle Rebel Intent on Spin, Beauty, and Emotional Expression.\r\n\r\nMany of us who''ve watched Kenny these past several years, would undoubtedly agree.', 11200, NULL, 'M', 0),

I became a more frequent and better thrower while at Carnegie-Mellon University in the late 60''s. We liked to sail Master discs down a slope in Schenley Park nearby. Three fraternity brothers would take turns throwing all the way to the bottom of the slope, retrieved by the bottom player and relayed back to the top by the third player half-up the hill.\r\n\r\nThrough the early 70''s, I continued to hone my throwing and catching ability with my friend, Dan Burleson. We played in the streets and parks of East Hartford, Connecticut. The promise of better jobs took both of us to California where we continued playing Frisbee in the park.\r\n\r\nBy now a typical Saturday morning began at 7:30 with a round of disc golf  on our new self-designed course at Santa Clara Central Park, followed by some pick-up Ultimate play at 10 AM, then freestyle in the afternoon, all at the same park. In the fall of 1978, we spotted a poster for an Indian Summer Frisbee tournament at the University of Sonoma.\r\n\r\nSince we could do that BTB and UTL catch thing, we thought we knew everything about Frisbee tossing. Boy, did we have our eyes opened. This "delay" stuff was unbelievable. It was exciting and beautiful. I was blown away by folks like Laura Engel and g. Rose, along with Corey Basso and Evan David. Everyone at the tournament was so far ahead of me. Man, did I want to learn how to do that "delay" thing. I mustered up the courage and asked Laura to show me how to do it. She made it looks so easy. \r\n\r\nMy love of freestyle has been unabated since I first saw it. Dan and I went home from that tournament and practiced self-sets in our living rooms, measuring the increasing time that we could hold a center  delay. Finally we went to the park to actually see if we could receive and delay a throw from each other. It seemed we''d been doing counter self-sets, but were throwing backhands at the park. It didn''t take long to realize that we had to use the Ultimate forehand throw.\r\n\r\nI talked Dan into partnering at a later tournament. Strong winds, unfamiliar to us, destroyed us and we finished dead last, but it took courage to even go out there. I started playing a lot more than Dan. A job assignment  took me to Texas, where I started jammin'' on the weekends with Bob Coleman and played in a couple of Austin tournaments.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to California, I started playing in Carmel with Joe Messner and a couple of teenagers named Tony Grissom and Dave Murphy. Joe and I took the Masters freestyle title at San Diego in 1983 and repeated a few years later.\r\n\r\nI have played in tournaments every year since. I''ve played in twenty-some Masters Tournaments, doing all the events. I cherish the times and partners I''ve had over the years at these tourneys. These days, I especially enjoy the FPA Worlds tournaments, because it''s non-stop, hot freestyle for three days.\r\n\r\nI captured a tenth freestyle title in the Senior Grand Master division in San Diego in the Summer of 2005, 22 years after my first win there. Since I turned 55, I have seven consecutive freestyle wins in the Senior Grandmaster division. My career highlight has to be the 2008 US Open Freestyle championship with Steve Scannell.\r\n\r\nI like to joke about my success being due to longevity and outlasting my peers.

The Wright Life has run contests, event promotions, and specialty demonstrations for over 15 years. Creating exciting opportunities for the Fort Collins community and beyond.  Here are some of the highlights on our history, so far.\r\n\r\n1977- The Grateful Disc Frisbee Club is registered by Wham-O ''s International Frisbee Association and becomes the first and still existing Frisbee club on the Colorado State University campus.  Bill Wright is a founding member.\r\n\r\n1979- First National Frisbee tournament held in Ft. Collins at Colorado State University with the Grateful Disc Frisbee club as hosts.\r\n\r\n1980-  Bill Wright and  ýThe Coloradicalsý win their first of five world titles at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Bill Wright takes over director position of the Freestyle Players Association for the next twelve seasons. \r\n\r\n1981- The Wright Life Sports store opens in October in their current location of 200 Linden in Old Town Fort Collins.

Wright agreed to cease sales through the Rolling Stone magazine, no other action was taken. Bill Wright Competes in one of the first Snowboard contests in Colorado held at Berthoud Pass ski area. One of the only Ski areas in the nation to allow snowboarders on the mountain at the time. Snowboards had no edges and wood bases. Skegs on the back of the board provided the only grip for carving turns. \r\n\r\n1983- The Grateful Disc Frisbee Club installed Coloradoýs first 18 hole permanent Frisbee Golf 	course on the Colorado State University Campus. Donated by disc manufacturer, Discraft Products. The sport has grown to be very popular amongst college students. The first ýrealý Frisbee golf discs are developed by Innova Champion discs and carried by The Wright Life. Probably the first retail store to carry golf specific flying discs. \r\n\r\n1984- Old Town Square opens in June with the Old Town Street Fair-. The Wright Life, in the heart of Old Town, runs the first Skateboard contest in Colorado in over 5 years. It was the first ever streetstyle skateboard contest in Colorado. The business atmosphere in Downtown begins drastic change to an acceptable shopping area and family place. Skateboarding makes good first impression. \r\n1985- The first ever Footbag tournament held in Fort Collins, sponsored by The Wright Life.  \r\n\r\n1986- The Wright Life becomes the first store in Fort Collins to carry in-line skates. The Wright Life hosts the Freestyle Players Association World Championships. Per Welinder, Joe Johnson, and Kevin Staab Demo at the 3rd Annual Streetstyle Skateboard Contest in Old Town, Ft Collins.

Again nearly 3,000 spectators witness some of the finest vert skating in history. The Wright Life suggests the City to get involved with the development of a skateboard arena for Fort Collins. The natives have become restless with the growth of skateboarding in the area and the use of natural street terrain as skating obstacles. \r\n\r\n1989 - Ray Barbie and ýActioný Jackson together to demonstrate in-line and skateboarding. The crowd general goes crazy and the days of skateboard demos in Old Town end.  The Wright Life assists a private developer in the first major indoor skate park in Colorado. The facility had a bowl, mini half-pipe, vert half-pipe and street ramps. The park closed in less than two years. \r\n\r\n1990- First ever in-line skate race held in Fort Collins, only the second race ever in Colorado. Sponsored and promoted by The Wright Life. The Wright Life finally succeeded in convincing The City of Ft. Collins to install an 18 hole Official Frisbee Golf course at Edora Park. After six years of proposals the City is overwhelmed by the response. The course has since been used in National and International Disc Golf events. Thousands of rounds are played each month.  \r\n\r\n1991 - First Criterium In-Line Skate Race in Fort Collins held on CSU campus in September. Sponsored and promoted by The Wright Life.\r\n\r\n1992- U.S Open flying Disc Championships to be held in Fort Collins. Produced and sponsored 	by The Wright Life and Wham-O manufacturing. Eight different countries are represented.\r\n\r\n1993- Wright Life participates with Triple Crown Sports on the first National in-line race and Hockey series. The Wright Life purchases the rights to the Ultimate 4th of July one of the Nationýs most competitive Ultimate Frisbee events. The Wright Life hosts & produces the PDGA World Amateur Disc Golf Championships. \r\n1994- Bill Wright elected President of the World Flying Disc Federation. Linden Hotel  renovation is completed after 11 years of being condemned across the street from The Wright Life. The Wright Life hosts The U.S. Open Flying Disc Championships for the second time. The Wright Life bring in Invisible and Think on two different demonstration tours. The response was terrific for the local skaters.  The Old School and Streetstyle contest was also held at City Park in Ft Collins. The Old School contest featured high jump and a slalom course.\r\n\r\n1995 - Finally, after nearly 10 years of persistence and determination the City of Ft Collins installs the first Skate park at its temporary location in Rolland Moore Park. The Skate Park was later moved to The Northside Community Center. The Wright Life first approached the city in 1985 about this project. The Wright Life succeeds in selling the idea of Disc Golf to Aspen Skiing Company. A 18 hole course is installed on the top of Aspen Mountain. It becomes the highest disc golf course in the world at 11,212 feet. An annual event called ýKiss the Skyý emerges as a player favorite. As president of The World Flying Disc Federation, Bill Wright represents flying disc sports in their successful attempt to be included in (GAISF) The General Assembly of International Sports Federations and (IWGA) The International World Games Association. The GAISF congress was held in Seoul, Korea.  \r\n\r\n1996 - Bill Wright wins The World Frisbee Freestyle Championships in New York City with partners Larry Imperiale and Randy Silvey. It was the first world title for Wright in ten years. The Wright Life hosts the Frisbee U.S Open Flying Disc Championships. The event airs nationally on Outdoor Life network. Locally the "Days of Plunder" Invisible skateboard tour was brought to town sponsored by The Wright Life. The Wright Life celebrates its 15th Anniversary.\r\n\r\nThis is all I have so far. I''ll fill this gap in later.\r\n\r\n2004 - We''ve now celebrated our 22nd Anniversay as a retail and mail order company specializing in Flying Discs.

And a wonderful way to work-out." \r\n\r\nEarlier in 1987, he made the US Open Freestyle Finals with Peter Laubert and Randy Wylot (or was it Chris Ryan?) and again the following year with Tim and Tom Salit. \r\n\r\nHis penchant for trying extremely contorted moves earned him the nickname "Big Uggo".

I was mesmerized by their performance and was hooked. After 15 years of organized sports, I liked the fact that there were no coaches, no set practice times and you didn’t have to get wet! Ironically, The Colorado Swim Team would spend a month in the winter training in San Diego. We stayed in condo’s across the street from La Jolla Cove, one of the early jamming capitals of the world. It was a great opportunity for me to meet and jam with local players like John Jewel, Rick Le Beau and Donny Wallace. I fell in love with San Diego and as soon as I graduated I moved to the area. I’ve been here ever since. \r\n\r\nMy greatest highlights come from the amazing people and extraordinary places I’ve experienced through Disc Sports. In my early days, road trips with the Coloradicals stand out. Especially the time we accidentally left Bill somewhere between Colorado and California without wallet, ID or money. I was driving with Rick, and Bill was driving with Doug Branningan.  Bill got out of the camper truck to go to the bathroom, Doug didn’t know it and drove off. Several hours later, we realized our mistake. Bill hitchhiked the rest of his way and arrived an hour before us! (Bill has confirmed these details, so it''s not just jammer legend.)\r\n\r\nMy first World Championship with Carolyn Yabe-Hubbard and the many shows and demos with Rick Castiglia were highlights.

Cutting school and going to Folsom Lake was to be with friends and play frisbee.  Thanks Josh.  Later, getting together for a few beers with friends was, typically, after playing frisbee.  Thanks Jeff. Thanks Toddy. Thanks Jason.  Seems I then began to plan my travels around frisbee tournaments.  Seems even now Frisbee has been a factor in many of my large decisions in life.  That "special weekend away" when I asked Michele to marry me, I found a way to squeeze in a jam. Thanks Paul.  Our wedding rings were tied to a Styler, not a pillow, and although surprised, she was actually ok with that. Thanks Michele.  Our move to Florida was even inspired by frisbee. Sorry Mom.\r\n\r\nMy best friends are frisbee players.  The friends.  The sharing.  The giving back.  The welcoming attitude.  It''s the VA States.  It''s the Santa Cruz memories from way back.  It''s the playing on beaches in Monterey, Newport, Jacksonville, and Aruba.  It''s places like Lover''s Point, Harkness, Boston, Bellingham Common, and the Washington Monument.  It''s the margaritas after a hot afternoon jam.  It''s the seed busting in the first round, only to collapse in the second.  It''s the phone call from another player saying he''s gonna be in town.  It''s the anticipation of having plane tickets to a tournament 2 months away.  It''s the picking off nail glue residue for a few days after a weekend jam.\r\n\r\nIt''s that feeling when playing; things are clicking; the body is fluid, the mind is ahead of the physical; and suddenly I realize I haven''t thought about deadlines, I haven''t thought about bills - I''ve been feeling the moment, enjoying the moment, confidently, without hesitation, without forethought and it feels so good...\r\n\r\nThere''s nothing like sharing that inner, satisfying, friendly smile after a jam amongst "Family."

Fantastico.\r\nThis tournament was so well run! From the grandstands, to the warmup area under a big tent, to the large red carpet playing area, the sound system, the media coverage and of course the warm and friendly people making sure everyone was taken care of at all times. Clay, Lui, Jumpi, Manu and all the Cota & Tequilla staff deserve the highest praises for an outstanding event. It was the largest crowd to witness an FPA Worlds final as well as the largest international participation ever.  \r\n\r\nEveryone who was new to freestyle was literally blown away by the high level of play and the openess of the established players towards all the new players. There was over 70 players - including more than 10 that had learned to play in the past 6 months! This may turn out to be the type landmark event that helps transform a sport. What a tremendous year this has been for freestyle!!! \r\n\r\nPlayers came from 13 countries: Hungary (2), Switzerland (3), Holland (2), Sweden (6), Norway (1), Denmark (1), England (1), France (4), Israel (1), Cananda (1), Germany (1), Puerto Rico (1), Italy (30+) and America (20+). \r\n\r\nNot all the players competed but I think everyone had a very memorable and wonderful time. The wind was strong for the finals so teams had to scramble a bit to hit their moves but the crowd was very appreciative of the extra effort and stayed to watch the final routines perform. The number of spectators at a single time was around 600, and over the course of the weekend there was well over 3,000 spectators. Many different local and national television and news media covered the event as well. \r\n\r\nWhen the final results were posted there were many firsts...It was the first time an all Sweden team made it to the Open finals of the FPA Worlds, and the first time a Swedish team took top 3 in Women, Sune is the fist player from Norway to win an FPA World title, Clay''s 3rd place finish in Open pairs was the highest finish ever by an Italian at the FPA Worlds. Congratulations to all the winners and all the competitors for the great spirit shown all weekend! Also, props to Randy Silvey who won the Spirit of the Jam award!!! \r\n\r\nBut the results and records took a back seat to new friendships made and the great hospitality shown by our Italian hosts - Grazie Italia!!!

The\r\nbest performances I saw were Eduardo and\r\nAlessandro - hitting nice co-ops, big air and\r\nrevving up the crowd.  Paul and Reto shredded,\r\nand Clay played awesome.  Once the 6 teams made\r\nit to the Disco the rest had a 2nd chance for the\r\nfinal spot in the disco...Lui thought it was a\r\ngood idea to give the players another chance to\r\npolish their competition skills by having another\r\nround of play, an idea started by the Swedish\r\nplayers aka ''B-Final''. \r\n\r\nIt was a fierce battle and it came down to\r\nexecution under challenging conditions - Andrea\r\nand Antonio, Mark and Matteo and newcomers Fabbio\r\nand Stefano all performed well.  But 9 months\r\nafter learning to delay Fabbio and Stefano pulled\r\noff the upset by hitting nice co-ops and playing\r\nto the crowd.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the co-op Semi saw 14 year old\r\nIsraeli jamming sensation Lusti perform - he was\r\na crowd favorite all weekend in the countless jam\r\nsessions on the beach and ''red carpet'' (now red\r\nplastic playing surface).  It was also great to\r\nsee the lone femme-jammer Hila jam with Paolo\r\nfrom Rome local Rimini prodigy Luca. Other\r\nhighlights were watching newcomers Fabbio and\r\nStefano hookup with fellow sinistra (counter)\r\njammer Gregory from Amsterdam. Jan from Denmark\r\nand Iwan from Amsterdam complimented the Beast in\r\nco-op with their clock brushing skills and big\r\nair catches.\r\n\r\nANDREA MEOLA- ANTONIO PICCIONI - DORI YANIV were\r\nfun to watch all weekend.  Andrea is in the early\r\nrunning with Eduardo and Fabbio and others for\r\nmost improved and Antonio, a award winning\r\nmarathon runner from Milan fired up the crowd\r\nwith big air and high energy.  Dori may have been\r\nthe busiest man at Paganello, when he wasn''t\r\njamming he was holding freestyle clinics and\r\nnetworking with countless ultimate players\r\ninterested in freestyle.  There were dozens of\r\nnew players that didn''t compete, all together\r\nthere must have been about 70 + jammers - and\r\nonly 6 from the US!\r\n\r\nIn the Disco the late start time seemed to hurt\r\nthe teams concentration a bit and nobody really\r\nhit big time but the crowd was psyched and the\r\nbiggest energy show of the year was again an\r\nunbelievable thrill.  (I''ll leave all the details\r\nabout the parties to your imagination!)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the sun was out again and the freestyle\r\nat times sizzled!  Only 4 teams made it the\r\nfinals in each division and in the Co-op Reto,\r\nPaul and Gary were the winners with a nicely\r\nchoreographed, multi-disc routine.  \r\nCongrats to Reto and Gary for their first\r\nPaganello wins, this may have also been Reto''s\r\nfirst win and for Gary his first since winning\r\nthe Worlds in ''95!\r\n\r\nTaking 2nd was me, Clay and Pipo - we had some\r\ngreat moments but a few too many drops.  In 3rd\r\nplace was Mark Regalbuti teaming with Roma\r\nshredders Alessandro and Eduardo.  Mark infused\r\nhis years of experience into their routine giving\r\nthe Romans some needed mentoring in choreography\r\nand approach to tournament play - bravo Maro and\r\nthe Romans!  Filling in for Clay on Cuakka Uakka\r\nwas Matteo and he played his usual solid game\r\nwhich fit in well with Lorenzo''s turn-over body\r\nroll work and ''Style-Nando''s'' "too sexy" moves.\r\n\r\nIn the Open Pairs the wind was a little better\r\nand it seemed to make a big difference.  All 4\r\nteams had 3 or fewer drops in the final and in\r\nthe end Clay and Tommy (me) took the title.  Not\r\nonly the freestylers but the ultimate players and\r\neven the Mayor were excited for Clay - this was\r\nhis first win at Paganello and he earned it! \r\nClay hit big combo after big combo and helped\r\nfire up his partner to push the boundaries\r\nhitting 2 ''10'' combos.  2nd place went to Paul\r\nand Reto - they had a really creative and fun\r\nroutine combining acrobatic and technical moves\r\nto the music.  3rd place went to wind jammers\r\nPipo and the Beast and Alessandro and Eduardo\r\nfinished 4th.  It was an awesome way to end\r\nPaganello with all the teams in the Open Pairs\r\nfinals hitting with very few drops.  At the\r\nawards ceremony Mark Regalbuti and Steve Hays\r\n(Buti and the Beast) were acknowledged for their\r\ncontributions to the sport...Mark had generously\r\nhelped Italian players compete at the FPA Worlds\r\nlast year, and the Beast had travelled to Italy\r\nto help mentor Fabbio and Stefano in Trieste.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of the Game award, voted by the\r\nplayers, was awarded to Fabbio, his web site\r\nfreeskyler.com has helped spread the jam and his\r\nlove for the game is catching....\r\n\r\nFrom Iwan (AmsterJam):\r\n\r\nLast year I went to the F.P.A. in Rimini and I had the idea nothing could ever equal that experience (except for another FPA in Rimini).

The weather forecast had not looked so good, but it turned really nice, the sun got out, everybody tanned in a day and the wind got as good as it could be. Don''t we all love light sea breeze best? (except for maybe Pipo, who like he proved on last years FPA final, can probably even handle hurricane like conditions). A giant ultimate tournament was taking place (joined by, what I heard about 1500 people). I was there for a wonderful freestyle tournament, joined by the greatest players in the world, but not only them.... also the less experienced(,... Like all Jammers should;) On the beach: freestyle workshops, many people jamming and shredding and others just enjoying other people''s moves.

The weather couldn''t have been any better - sunny every day with highs in the mid 70''s and a soft ocean breeze. 2 rounds of preliminaries on the beautiful fields at UCSC led up to Friday''s much anticipated semi finals indoors at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. \r\n\r\nSemi Finals \r\n\r\nThe first round in the Open division was absolutely smokin''! The trouble is when so many teams play well that one or more team that played well doesn''t advance. This was the case for the Velasquez brothers who, despite a few mistakes, played brilliantly. The 4 teams that followed all knew they had to play their best or be on the sidelines for the finals, and each team did what they had to do to advance in one of the best semi final rounds in recent memory. \r\n\r\nThe women''s semi went pretty much as expected with the top 4 teams advancing to the final. It was fun to see new pairings in the women''s division - and it looked like each team had put a good amount of time into their routines which added to the anticipation of Saturday''s Final at Cabrillo. \r\n\r\nThe second round in the Open division had some great moments but overall the play did not compare to the earlier pool. Perhaps because of the late start time - the last team to play Ted and Dave M. started their routine before midnight and finished just after midnight Saturday morning. \r\n\r\nWomen''s Final\r\n\r\nIn the Women''s final Mary Lowery and Judy Robbins hit enough big combos - including Mary''s sick bad attitude catch and digitronic and Judy''s awesome 50-50-50 roll, to take the gold. Lisa and Cindy came away with silver after a very promising start to their routine led to a couple costly breaks in flow. They deserve a lot of credit for battling back several times and getting their routine back on track. Third place went to Lori Daniels (a newly crowned world champion for her win in DDC) and her partner Anne Graves. These ladies look good together as their styles compliment each other very well. Mandy Carriero and Bethany Sanchez took forth place with a nice routine finishing less than 3 points out of medal contention. \r\n\r\nOpen Pairs Final\r\n\r\nCongratulations to Arthur and Dave on their win...I am waiting to see the video before I can report on this round since I was warming up during most of the routines. \r\n\r\nThere were lots of familiar faces on the sidelines:\r\n\r\nStork (who incidentely retired from his WFDF position at the tourney), John Kirkland (who won DDC w/ Greensage), Tom Boda, Tom Shephard, Evan David, Z, San Francisco''s Sun Ray Hawk and Dave Zooninis, Modesto Mutant Evan Furtado, Ron Kaufman, Craig Simon, Jon Anthony, Glen Whitlock, Joan Amberg, Heather Gray, Richie Bartal, Mark "Dr Disc" Atherton, Tom Sahlit, Doug "stat man" Korns, Johnny "Air" O''Malley, Farmer Mike and Tam, Beast, Carl Dobson, Melissa Trail, Matt Gauthier, Dave and Amy Schiller, Steve Hubbard and Carolyn Yabe, Marco Regalbuti, Tom Cole and many others.', 'y', 'www.worlddiscgames.com', 'ts@worlddiscgames.com', 'US - West', NULL),

But\r\non Saturday morning the sun was bright and the\r\nsky blue as medium to soft breezes swept across\r\nthe flat playing surface Paul and his staff had\r\nprepared for us on the beach.  The surface was\r\nlaid down using sections of wood which had been\r\ncovered with a  thin blue carpet providing\r\nexcellent playing conditions.\r\n\r\n15 teams competed in Saturday''s open pairs\r\nsemifinal with Paolo Magni/Matteo Feller narrowly\r\nmissing the finals in pool A and Mauro Mercuri\r\nand Fernando "Too Sexy" Botrugno tying for 1st in\r\nexecution in pool B.\r\nThere was a tie for 1st in pool B between the\r\nRoman team Alessandro and Edoardo and Andrea\r\nMeola and Antionio "Piccio" Cusma''\r\nfrom Milan.\r\n\r\nIn the Co-op Semifinal 12 teams battled for 6\r\nspots in the finals and the upset of the\r\ntournament happened when the team of Paolo\r\nMagni/Matteo Feller/Possenti Massimo went from a\r\n5th seed position to taking 2nd in their pool\r\nhitting lots of co-ops and dropping only 4 during\r\ntheir 5 minute routine.  Mauro Mercuri/Claudio\r\nMassaro/Luca Mazzucato showed much improvement\r\nand missed the finals by only 1.5 points. \r\nLorenzo and Fernando hooked up with Roland\r\nKarlsson from Sweden and hit a very nice routine\r\nwinning their pool. \r\n\r\nIn pool B Clay, Andrea M and Piccio got really\r\nhot a won their pool by 15 points.\r\n\r\nAfter Saturday nights ''Quentin Tarantino'' party\r\nthe players were on the field early Sunday to get\r\nsome in some good jams before the Finals.\r\n\r\nSunday''s finals featured players from Sweden, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Denmark, Holland and Italy.  37\r\nplayers competed and there were many others on\r\nthe sidelines including Steve Hays, John Titcomb,\r\nmyself and several Italian newcomers.\r\n\r\nThe Open pairs finals was quite a battle with 4\r\nteams having 3 or fewer drops and the lowest\r\nscore of the 8 teams was a respectable 7.6.  \r\nOnly 2.2 points separated the 5th - 8th place\r\nteams and taking 8th place was Fernando and Mauro\r\nfrom Rome - they had a very solid round with only\r\n3 drops.  7th went to Edoardo and Alesandro also\r\nfrom Rome - they scored well in difficulty but\r\nhad a few untimely drops.  The counter /clock\r\nteam of Tommy Gereben from Austria and Iwan\r\nDeMoor from AmsterJam placed 6th - they decided\r\nto set their individual combos themselves and\r\npaced their routine to reggae music - the\r\ncombination seemed to work well as they dropped\r\nonly 2.\r\n\r\nTaking 5th place was Fabio and Stefano from\r\nTrieste: they didn''t hit their routine like they\r\ndid at the World Championships in Rimini but\r\nearned 5th place dropping only 3.\r\nLorenzo from Rome and Roland from Sweden had good\r\ndifficulty and hit some nice co-ops placing 4th.\r\n\r\nTaking 3rd place was Stefan and Joakim from\r\nSweden in one of the most shredding routines of\r\nthe year.  If it wasn''t for a short meltdown\r\nwhere they dropped the disc 3 times attempting an\r\nupsidedown co-op they would have definitely\r\nchallenged for the title.  Their routine featured\r\na variety of hein spinning combos, a triple,\r\nscarecrow brushes foot brush passes and\r\nconsecutive moves.  In 2nd place was the team\r\nfrom Rimini Clay and Matteo, it''s apparent that\r\nthey are comfortable playing together, they hit\r\nlots of flowing co-ops and Clay''s shredding indys\r\npropelled them to near the top of the difficulty\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\nAndrea Meola and Antonio "Piccio" Cusma'' from\r\nMilan were not only able to find the zone but to\r\nstay in the zone for almost the entire routine\r\nbringing the crowd into a frenzy by the end of\r\ntheir inspired routine.  With only 2 drops and 1\r\nminor bobble they won all 3 categories leaving no\r\ndoubt about who won.  Congratulations to Andrea\r\nand Piccio!\r\n\r\nThe sizzling play of the pairs final did not\r\ncarry over into the Co-op Final as 5 of the 6\r\nteams ended up with 10 drops or more.  Placing\r\n6th was the Cinderella team of  Paolo\r\nMagni/Matteo Feller/Possenti Massimo with Paolo\r\nhelping hold their routine together making\r\nseveral key catches.  5th went to the\r\n"Swe-Den-Mark" team of Stefan, Joakim and Jan\r\nSoerenson as the had some great moments - it was\r\nthe highest finish ever by a Danish Freestyler -\r\ncongrats to Jan!  \r\n\r\nThe 4th place team of Paolo/Edo/Ale from Rome\r\nkept the crowd entertained during their fast\r\npaced routine passing the disc more than anyone\r\nelse and keeping the disc and the bodys moving at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nRoland Karlsson hooked up with Lorenzo and\r\nFernando and were able to endure a music\r\nmalfunction to take 3rd place carried by a very\r\nsolid performance from Fernando who hit a double\r\nspinning gitis at an important point in the\r\nroutine.  \r\n\r\nClay Collera'' hooked up with pairs champs Andrea\r\nand Antonio and there were moments when they were\r\nplaying off the charts as they played infront of\r\nthe biggest crowd of the weekend because the\r\nultimate final had just finished before their\r\nroutine and hundreds of ultimate players came to\r\nwatch along with the hundred or so spectators\r\nalready in attendence. They had the potential to\r\nwalk away with victory but could not make enough\r\ncatches to secure the title.\r\n\r\nWhat does Austria have in common with Trieste? \r\nWell, they are not very far apart on the map for\r\none thing and now they have one more thing in\r\ncommon - they both have frisbee players who are\r\nthe current European Freestyle Frisbee Champs. \r\nThe all counter team of Tommy Gereben, Fabio\r\nSanna and Stefano Mestroni had high difficulty,\r\nsolid presentation and won execution by 4 drops. \r\nIn winning the co-op division the young boys from\r\nTrieste followed the example set by the cagey\r\nveteran from Austria who kept his cool and made\r\ngood decisions using solid sets for his catches\r\nin a changing wind.  It was a well deserved win\r\nfor this team and especially Tommy G. who is the\r\nfirst Austrian to win a large freestyle event. \r\nTommy has been stylin'' since the late 70''s though\r\nhis body shows no signs of slowing - his flips,\r\nhandstand catches, double spins and aerial moves\r\nfired up the crowd all weekend.  Big props to\r\nTommy for his first big win!\r\n\r\nThe Intermediate final saw Fabio''s younger\r\nbrother and nephew Marco and Davide Sanna show\r\ntheir stuff - these boys may give Lusti and Amit\r\na run for their money by next year.\r\n\r\nEleonora Imazo stepped up and showed how much she\r\nhas improved also with Fabio''s help.  Gaia, Sara,\r\nAlice and Matteo continue to show that Torino is\r\nbecoming another Italian hot bed for freestyle.\r\nTimmy Broxap(4th) has been freestyling for 2\r\nmonths - he has already developed a good wind\r\ngame and is doing double leg overs. This 17 year\r\nold phenom is determined along with friend and\r\nfellow UK jammer Russel Scott (2nd) to put\r\nEngland on the freestyle map.\r\n\r\nPlacing 3rd and 1st in intermediate were jam\r\npartners Valerio Occorsio and Giovanni Coppo from\r\nItaly. These boys are well on their way reaching\r\nthe pro level.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Paul Bernier and his staff for\r\norganizing this event, providing the stage, sound\r\nsystem, food and accomodations.  The beach cabins\r\nwere great - each win a shower and kitchen for\r\nonly 10 euros per night.\r\nWe could not have run this event without Luigina\r\n- she worked non-stop through the weekend\r\nannouncing, keeping time, organizing judges,\r\netc., etc. Grande Bacio Lui!\r\n\r\nThe future of freestyle is bright here in Europe\r\nand we are looking forward to EFC 2005!

We met indoors and jammed just long enough to get hungry and meet for mexican food. Saturday began with a ghetto fabulous breakfast of pancakes, eggs, milk, coffee, yogurt,toast, bagels, o.j., and other things. We had a small meeting for the format, and went straight to the field. The weather wasn''t perfect as promised, but it was ok. The wind was stiff, but very manageable, and to the liking of many, and there were a couple of brief sprinkles. After 2:00 in the afternoon though, the weather couldn''t hold off any longer, and it brought us beautiful wind, and some pleasant sun to boot. The music system was kicking, with our music man Humpy spinning the tunes, and the jam food kept us jamming throughout the day. \r\n\r\nSaturday was marked by beautiful play from everybody. Dave Lewis hit the most hein singles move tourney, but if there was an award to most explosive, it would have gone to Jeff Kruger with a double barrel roll brush. "WOW" Is all I can say.....I didn''t see it coming. Melissa Trail, and Mike Galoupe played pairs together. While pairs are played in random order, I think it is safe to say that they seed busted. They both played out of their minds. Look out for these two in the future. Their games are improving and they know how to use it! Saturday found people jamming into the sunset, and waiting for Sunday. The next day as promised was perfect. Close to 70 degrees, mild winds, and beach for days. I think I got sunburnt. We jammed for a few hours and people had to go home. \r\n\r\nThanks to everybody who made this tournament possible. And thanks to those of you who showed up. Your presence and input is appreciated.

Maybe it''s the triviality of the exercise of chasing something that bounces around in the wind, catching it and then sending it off into space again. Could it be the precision needed to make the plastic do special maneuvers while under your ultimate control? Whatever it is, "It" makes me young. \r\n\r\nWhen I was in elementary school, I had a friend who lived on the main street in town and my friend, Cliff, owned a German-Shepherd-sized mutt named Skip that chased cars incessantly. Skip would spend all day long waiting for another car to come by the house, and he''d crouch down hiding as if ready to pounce, and he''d suddenly take off on a full gallop as the car passed and he''d race it until it pulled away. No sooner would that car get away, and then Skip would get in position to do it again. He wouldn''t bark he''d simply race the car for fifteen or twenty yards before losing the race. \r\n\r\nI''m a bit like Skip, since no matter how many times I throw a disc and chase it again or try to maneuver the outcome of the flight, to master its flight, I have to do it again. Compulsive behavior maybe but, as with much compulsive behavior, there''s great pleasure. Especially if after a while you''re gaining on that car, or in my case learning another way to master the disc''s magic and it''s path as it resists gravity. There are so many variables to pursue when developing one''s talent with freestyle Frisbee, just as there was an endless number of cars for Skip to chase. The reason I mentioned Skip, the dog, is that years later after I returned from college and the military, I''d pass Skip on the main street when I went back home. I''d wonder to myself how old he must have been as he continued to race each car that passed. I tried to do the math in my head. What was more amazing was that he had not lost a step. I asked my brother if it were a different but similar looking dog, but he''d attest that it was still Skip, and he was still racing each car he''d see. Several years later, I''d return home and this dog, in his twenties by now, was still chasing cars. I suppose all that exercise kept him young, even though he was elderly as described in dog years.\r\n\r\nWoof! Woof! There''s nothing like a flying gitis on the seashore to keep this old dog going.  Recently I visited one of the fountains of youth, the beach at Isla Verde in Puerto Rico. There''s nothing I love more than to go on a pilgrimage to some of the many shrines around the world where wind and water frame the practice area we refer to as the beach.  Whether it''s La Jolla Shores, Rimini, Jacksonville, Newport, or even the ''cement beach'' in Chicago, they''re all beaches, and it''s where one escapes time. I turn back the clock and retain the youth of freestyle every time I play with my disc and friends along the shore. \r\n\r\nThis shrine located just a few miles east of the timeless walled city of ''Old San Juan'' is the domain of Carlos ''Pipo'' Lopez, a freestyle missionary, who has visibly preached and demonstrated the concept to many followers. Some of his local jamming disciples consist of Tito ''Mex'', Cuqui, Mario, and Abraham. Each of these Puerto Rican jammers can hold his own in any tournament around the world, but they rarely get a chance to get off the island.  Under Pipo''s tutelage they have developed their own personal tricks, as well as a full array of more popular standard freestyle moves while they stay young. One Puerto Rico alumni, Tito Andino, has carried me to the finals two years consecutively in Paul Kenny''s Jacksonville competition. Tito came home for this particular weekend after a ten-year hiatus away  since he heard there''d be a number of jammers coming in from all over. Bill Dubillier came in from New York, and Toddy Brodeur from New England. Rumors of Pat Marron, John Titcomb, and some other mystery jammers sweetened the prospect of jamming for an extended weekend, like coming back to home cooking. And he did frolic for hours like a teenager. We all did.  We played for hours on the beach, day and night. Each evening, starting Wednesday when I arrived at dusk with my trusty flying-ring bearer, Anne Goh, we''d end up playing with Pipo till a full moon came up. Each night the moon would come up an hour later, and we would play an hour later by the additional radiance of the moon rising out on the sea. By Saturday night there was jamming going on two hours after the sun had set. It was magical. \r\n\r\nSunday was the climax of an incredible crescendo of four full days of jamming, as each player got hotter as players got more used to the unique beach conditions. There was talk about a competition, but no one wanted to deal with that hassle, since this was play of the highest order and we were having too much fun playing, like a bunch of little kids. On Sunday the beach came alive and there was a constant parade of onlookers passing by. People of all ages would stop and stare, since they were in awe of the childish delight being celebrated by these Frisbeeterians. \r\n\r\nIf Ponce de Leon had waited for an extra five hundred years he would have found the "Fountain of Youth" he sought while exploring Puerto Rico and Florida. Pipo Lopez has it in San Juan, and that is why I have visited Pipo on five different occasions. In 1994, after knee surgery, I first came to visit Senor Lopez in February as a form of spring training and escape from the ravages of a cold New England winter. (We have been known to jam on the beach in Newport even in January). When I returned home I was rejuvenated and my freestyle batteries charged. I recommend it to anyone who needs a charge, but please be aware this is definitely Pipo''s beach and a visit can be habit forming. The things he does on his beach are astonishing, as he has mastered the dips in the beach, the power of the wind, and the ability to show visitors phenomenal hospitality. Pipo does things on his beach that he does nowhere else in the world. So if you are one of numerous freestylers who admire Pipo''s game, you ''aint seen nothing'' till you see him on his beach. Each visitor who played while I was there had fantastic jams, inspired by his talent. \r\n\r\nBill Dubillier, who has been tending to the art of parenting recently, played better than I''ve ever seen him jam on Sheep''s Meadow or anywhere else. Toddy couldn''t sit down even with blisters on his feet, since he knew his play was inspired. His wife, Sammy, was worn out just watching him. Even the novice jammer, Anne Goh, was inspired and learned how to brush and flow with the disc on the beach. A new woman player might be in the making here. I couldn''t sit down, even on Monday night as most everyone was on his or her way home; I had to play solo with the wind for two more hours. They don''t call me Viejo in Puerto Rico any more; they call me ''The Machine''. Even twenty years ago, I never remembered being able to jam six days in a row without hurting myself. I simply have to chalk it up to freestyle and jamming with Pipo in the Fountain of Youth.            \r\n----------\r\nFrom Tito Andino:\r\n\r\nThis has had to be one of the best jams I''ve been in\r\nso far. Perfect weather, a great group of people, all\r\nin all a GREAT time. No one wanted to stop playing at\r\nany point, so the idea of a tournament was put aside\r\nand we all shredded it to pieces. Dusk did not\r\nstoppped us from playing well into the night with a\r\nfull moon as bright as ever. Some people will consider\r\nthis a "religious experience" , I am just thrilled to\r\nhave shared this weekend with Toddy, Steve\r\nScannel,Bill Dubalier,Pipo, Tito Mex, Cuqui, Mario and\r\neveryone else that showed up.(Few other local freinds\r\ncame to share this moment with us as well). Pipo was\r\nthe perfect host not only providing the lodging for\r\nsome of us, but also the night time entertainment.\r\nGreat food, great partying, looking forward to next\r\nwinter. Pipo, Thanks for putting this together for us.\r\nHope everyone has a save trip back. See You all soon.\r\nTito. \r\n----------------------\r\nFrom Toddy Brodeur:\r\n\r\nMark this one on next years calendar, The weekend after the superbowl go to Puerto Rico. Pipo takes care of you and you will have a blast. Also he will show you why he is "King of the Beach"\r\n\r\nThis was truly a frisbee beach lovers dream. Warm breezes were non stop, same direction. The sand is rather coarse so it hardly sticks to the disc. The beach has a slope and high tide is barely noticeable. All the locals have a similar style. Everybody jams barefoot and the disc is always wet and cleaned in the warm ocean waves. Truly beach jammin. The jam spot was less than 25 steps from our hotel room. Ok they were big steps because I was always running to the shore.The jams lasted well past sunset. The folks at the hotel were very friendly. The one thing I learned is when you go to PR,  do what Pipo does. Follow him, eat what he eats, hang out  with him, watch how he handles the disc and the beach and you will do fine.  Thank you for a wonderful time Pipo.  \r\n\r\nSee u  all soon\r\nToddy\r\n', 'y', '', 'batuman@caribe.net', 'US - East', NULL);

Due to an injury the team of Velasquez/Oberhaus scratched and the top 7 teams performed. Wind conditions varied from team to team as it turned into a battle of survival to see who could deal with the inconsistent winds the best. The Brothers Gauthier showed their unique style of combining speed flow and wind moves while co-oping back and forth to medium paced jazz fusion music. \r\n\r\nThe team of Kruger/Lopez complimented each other well, these turbo jammers pumped each other big Z''s and fired up the crowd with a variety of against moves and co-ops. Leitner/Marron had some big moments but relied on the inconsistent wind too often and accumulated too many drops. \r\n\r\nSilvey/Sanchez complimented each other''s styles very well. They hit smooth, consecutive combinations and used their strong wind games to deal with the choppy wind. Kenny/Yarnell provided the crowd to see yet another style of play as they used Paul''s mastery of the turnover and Dan''s multitude o hein moves to create a fast paced, enjoyable routine. \r\n\r\nImperiale/Rogers played the wind game to a Santana Song that starts fast then slows down - they played to the music effectively as the changing winds favored slower more methodical combinations. During one co-op Joel hit a scarecrow brush directlly to Larry''s Scarecrow brush cross-wind pass back to Joel - amazing! \r\n\r\nBy the time the last team took the field the defending champions, Coddington/Lewis knwe the title was once again within their grasp. The challenge was would they react well enough to the changing winds to secure the victory. They went for their high energy, high difficulty routine which was choreographed to an intense techno/heavy metal song. They hit a majority of their moves pulled out some incredible stuff but just not enough to overcome Joel & Larry. Congratulations Larry & Joel! \r\n--------\r\nMIXED PAIRS\r\nI wasn''t able to see all the teams in the Mixed Pairs final but I was very impressed with the winning routine by Paul Kenny and Cindy Kruger - lots of co-ops, double disc work and hi diff pushed them over the top for the victory. Props to Paul Kenny for winning his first Major Title and to Cindy on her first mixed pairs crown. \r\n\r\n OPEN CO-OP\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most polished co-op finals I''ve ever seen and though the wind was causing more drops than usual it was great to see so many different styles of routines going for the title. You had the controlled hein co-ops of Kruger/Lopez/Marron combined with big hi Z indy''s, the all out sponteineous shred by Fried/Hudoklin/Brodeur, the techno-hein heavy metal routine by Coddington/Lewis/Leitner, the groovey-groovey ''flow and go'' routine of Kenny/Imperiale/Rogers, the 3 disc acrobatic routine from Team Texas, and the dramatic multi-disc multi-style routine by Silvey/Oberhaus/Velasquez performed to the Doors, "The End". \r\n\r\nWhen all the results were tabulated the pres judges gave a big nod to Silvey/Oberhaus/Velasquez and Team Texas (Dosier/Haynes/Yarnell), and a slightly higher diff score was all Silvey/Oberhaus/Velasquez needed for the title. 3rd place went to Imperiale/Rogers/Kenny who won excecution but played a bit safe to merrit higher diff scores - they were however the only team in the finals with less than 6 drops. Coddington/Lewis/Leitner won the difficulty category but the drops and some mid routine confusion didn''t help. Overall, the co-op final was a great representation of what makes freestyle such a great sport - being able to have so many different styles of play and types of routines compete and play together.\r\n\r\nThe top women players decided to mix things up a bit this year. In hopes of getting some new players into the sport the decided to team up with new and up and coming players. It was refreshing to see some new faces out there in the Women''s Final. Taking 4th place was Tita Ugalde and Beth Verish, they showed a variety of moves including a nice speed flow sequence. In 3rd Lori Daniels and Renee Pardo played very well under the conditions and showed some nice team work forcing the teams that followed them to play well in order to beat them. Up for the challenge was Cindy Kruger and Sarah Bergman, Cindy is one of the top players and showed it, Sarah continues to improve and achieved her highest finish yet. \r\n\r\nWinning the Women''s final was the team of Judy Robbins and Bethany Sanchez with a solid routine that featured some nice co-ops, a few long combinations by Judy and consistent play by Bethany including a crushing Scarecrow towards the end of their routine. Congratulations to Bethany on her first World Title! \r\n\r\nDid you know.... \r\n\r\nErwin Velasquez became the first player in history to win major titles in 4 decades! \r\n\r\nLarry''s major moves him into a tie with Joey Hudoklin for most majors with 16. \r\n\r\nJoel and Larry became the 10th & 11th players to win FPA Pairs title more than once... \r\n\r\nDeaton/Jim (83, 84, 85, 86)\r\nSkippy (81, 89, 91)\r\nJoey (79, 87, 88)\r\nTom Leitner (89, 91)\r\nArthur & Dave (96, 01)\r\nRandy Siley (97, 00)\r\nDan Yarnell (99, 00)\r\nLarry (90, 02)\r\nJoel (92, 02)\r\n\r\nIt was the first time since 1996 that Arthur and Dave had not won a major title - a streak of 6 years.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The special friends getting together was equally important to the competition.\r\n \r\nI would like to thank a few folks. First and foremost was Dan Berman.  Dan is a crusty overaller many of us know.  He did the lion''s share of the driving to and from the airport, taking a HUGE load off everyone''s shoulders and wallets.  If you need a ride, refer folks to Jax Ride at 904 422 7433.  Some of you who got a ride may consider giving him a call and thanking him as well.  Others who gave a big help were local buds Sam Faber and Scott Hardy.  Sam has sponsored for many years as has Scott.  Scott also provided a banner and the huge poster we all signed.  Of course, J.T. Rosenthal came through in a monster way by showing up last minute and surprising the group with an awesome and free catered meal on Saturday night prior to the Toddy invoked tribal beach cleansing.  Carl Emerson (Emerson Signworks!) as always brings his big heart to the effort along with an awesome banner and stickers for everyone.  Tito and Lori taped the whole event with Tito digitizing the whole tourney and putting it in .wmv format on CD.  Gary Auerbach at www.spinningbees.com could not come out so donated water bottles to the event, timely with the big heat!\r\n \r\nPlayers package included an embroidered polo shirt, Gary''s bottles, an octopus shaped handheld massager, Carl''s sticker, special limited Mikondo Beach sand with signed and numbered certificates of authenticity and for a special few who "earned" them, tournament discs.\r\n \r\nSpecial jammer thanks go out to Lori and Lorenzo for making the long trip across their respective ponds to make this year''s Jammers the best yet.  They have forced the event to raise the bar and I believe stimulated a bunch of other folks to make the trip out.  Don''t forget the backbones of the tournament, perennial jammers Murf, Pipo and Jeff O''Brien as well as everyone else making the effort.  Flying or driving is an effort to make it out and is supremely appreciated.\r\n \r\nThere were many sideline jammers besides the great competitive field with Pat Carasco, John Cain, Darryl Allen and Rich Murray leading the charge.\r\n \r\nBut enough of the preliminaries.  Pipo wants to hear about his play :-)\r\n \r\nThe jamming was incredible with most hitting moves they only previously thought of doing.  Jeff O''Brien hit a gitis brush-gitis brush-gitis which was the move of the tournament.  Pipo hit a few triples, Murf had some incredible groundwork and triple stuff that you have to see to believe.  We brought Lorenzo over from Roma to help interpret Murf''s moves to no avail.  I think he jams in Sanskrit or something.  The TD even hit a triple scarecrow :-)  Deaton continues to amaze all of us with his understated control and depth of consecutivity.  Lori shredded and caught everything and carried her partner!  Cindy is just so dang turbo it is ridiculous, hitting power moves guys only dream of!  Jeff Kruger has a depth of game and is probably the most underrated top player today.  Steve Hanes was his name as usual.  Jambo jamboasted.  Laerbs Laerbsed and had a cool behind the neck outer rim hover delay.  Alan is expanding his game rapidly and showing he is to be reckoned with.  Carl was his usual steady self hitting bread and butter moves all over the sands.  Lorenzo has improved dramatically in the few days he has been out here and he peeled coming in!  It was good to see Dan Yarnell come out and shred for the public again, hitting his patented moves even after a bit of a layoff.  Contortion boy Hos makes everyone laugh whether shredding or just doing a comic show (we are laughing WITH you Gregg):-0  Rik and Craig were fun to watch taking control of the beach winds like the savvy veterans they are.  Renee plays with a level of expertise making one believe she has had many more years experience than she actually has had.  It was good to see first time Jammers competitors Anne and Berni come on out and quickly grasp the nuances of beach jam competition.  Oh, and Sara BERGMAN played out of her mind and shredding even after twisting her ankle just before going out.  \r\n \r\nI refuse to say much about Toddy or Pipo because they barely shredded incredibly leaving others in the dust.  They almost didn''t hit huge move after huge move.  Pipo may have hit numerous triples with some gitises thrown in but again just barely.  Toddy is just not capable of not playing well which makes it difficult for his partner to not play well too.  \r\n \r\nActually it was a 2 team race for first between Murf-Deaton and Toddy-Pipo with both just CRUSHING their semi pools.  The difference was Toddy and Pipo stayed right on it while Murf and Deaton, while still hitting ridiculous stuff, had a mild breakdown which was enough for Toddy and Pipo to eek out the W.  \r\n \r\nThere was a cool tie for third with PK and Lorenzo tying Laerbs and Jeff O''Brien.  It was the first time Jeff has finished top 3 and the first time an Italian jammer competed in the states and also finishing top three!  Amazing and very satisfying stuff for both.  A Tutto Gas to my great friend and incredible jammer Lorenzo.  A Tutto Gas to my great friend and incredible jammer Jeff.\r\n \r\nIn mixed there were an amazing 7 teams to begin with a drop to 6 when Cheryl and Steve bowed out due to Cheryl''s TD hostess demands.  It was an awesome round with all playing well.  It was fun to see the newcomers Anne and Berni with the goofballs that were their partners :-).  Renee and Carl are so fun to watch together and continue to grow together after playing with each other (jamming I mean) for many years.   Jeff Kruger and Sara put on a fun show that got them a third place slot and good experience competing as the FPA Worlds come up in Rimini.  It then came down to the 2 experienced teams.  Laerbs and Cindy came out and hit some awesome moves, shredding outstandingly and worthy of a W in most events.  But the Honolulu Hein, Lori, came out with her partner and put on quite a show.  Playing up to their music with appropriate props they came out the box and hit huge moves on music cues throughout.  Playing cleanly and with the big moments these 2 came out with Lori''s first mixed title.  \r\n \r\nMaking it the most special Jammers ever, it was Jammer Mom''s birthday that weekend.

A total of ten teams made up two pools of five for the 3 1/2 minute first round, then six teams put on a good show of five minute routines in the finals. \r\n\r\nThe top three teams all played very well. Lasher and Brandt jammed smooth and efficient, hitting all their stuff and executing well. Doug, Joe and Rob pulled out their signature brand of spontaneity, pulling off some excellent stuff while suffering from two lulls in their flow that kept them from reaching the top of the podium. Ted, Scott and Pipo were the cream of the crop in both rounds of competition. All three played smooth and consecutively, hitting their difficulty with ease. Ted set the stage for this threesome by pushing the button on his triple spinning flamingo on his first catch in the first round. And Scott and Pipo followed suit in their own ways.

In the interest of the list, I''ll be posting the results now, and then those who want the real stories can read about it later after enough haze leaves my brain to remember all the highlights. \r\n\r\nThis year the event moved gyms, to a nicer, more low key facility. The freestyle began at 4 pm and warm up jams continued until 7:15 when we cleared the floor for the players meeting. Pat Marron and Paul Smith from Minnesota and Rob Fried and Roger Meier from NYC were the top seeds and the other jammers agreed to put their names in a hat and go random draw. The outcome was that John O''Malley played with John Titcomb in a round that saw John Titcomb elevate his game to new levels and win the Jamco gitis award for a consec gitis pull combo into a gitis. O''Malley played free and it seemed as though he was able to conjour up the wind inside the gym at points for his brushing game. Jonathan played with Z and these guys looked like they had a plan things went so smoothly. Bob Boulware and Tommy L went out with a classic go for it attitude that saw their risk going off the scale, but had a hard time sealing the combos. \r\n\r\nRob Fried went off the scale during his round, Joey''s influence on his game is evident. Pure flow mixed with surprise and risk, I think he did drop one but I can''t remember how. Rob and Roger played the New YOrk flow game completely in character. \r\nLast up was Paul Smith and Pat Marron. They opened with some high difficulty double disc work, and then evovled into their jam game mixing it up with nice flowing co ops. Even through some the''s and a couple drops, they kept going for it, winning both the Risk and Vibe categories and ultimately edging the New York boys by a tenth. \r\n\r\nMore important info: It snowed, heavier than you would like, but soft fun to ski on. Although tough, it is possible to have a moonlit hot spring adventure. Organic is always better than chemical with regard to beer and goob and milk and fungi. Plastic indoors is better than no plastic at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nSee everybody in 2005! \r\nMikey \r\n\r\n', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

However here are the results and accompaning narrative.\r\n\r\nJudging system is the traditional "Pinball" method. Routines were 7 minutes\r\nlong (2 time outs per team).\r\n\r\nBonus Points (1-5 points for best example of the move were for:\r\nFlying Gitis\r\nBackroll to a team mates catch\r\nScarecrow Brush\r\n\r\nSuper Bonus Points (5 points if the move is completed)\r\nWater Catch\r\nTriple Spinning Catch\r\nUnder the leg cuff to team mate\r\n\r\nDifficulty (1-10 points)\r\n\r\nMaximum score for a team is 40 points.\r\n\r\nOpen Pairs (Saturday)\r\nMasters of the sliced orbular corpusle, Doug Korns and Mike Esterbrook pieced together a smooth flowing styled routine to take the fourth spot. Narrowly edging them out with what amounts to a bit of an upset was local chicka Melissa Trail and Seattle''s neophyte Mike Galup. Melissa is quickly picking the game up and showing new found confidence with each passing tourney. Mike''s go for it attitude made for some exiting moments. Their futile water gitis were as entertaining as it gets. 2nd place went to Jamie Chantilles and Marko Regalbuti. These guys were trying to bust huge moves but never quite put is all together. Highlights from the team were Buti''s huge flying Phlaud and Jamie''s big gitis. \r\n\r\nIn 1st place was resident shredster Skippy Jammer and the up and coming Matt Gauthier. This team made a huge statement with their first two moves. Skippy did a scarecrow brush to Matt''s massive gitis then Skippy did a skid combo to Matt''s solid scarecrow. Matt has developed into a high caliber player. His difficulty and execution are really coming together. Skippy went dropless until a couple of futile water catches with about 30 seconds left.\r\n\r\nCo-op (Sunday)\r\nThird place went to the spirited team of Melissa Trail, Mike Galup and Tam Wolfe. Highligts of the routine were Melissa and Tam''s back to back Bad Attitudes and Melissa''s huge gitis which was awarded as the "Biggest Gitis"\r\nfrom Jamie Chantilles. Second place went to Jamie Chantilles, Mark Regalbuti and Johnny "Sky" O''Malley. This team narrowly avoided an upset loss. It did not complete a single catagory until about 1 minute and a half was left in their routine. From Jamie''s 4th attempt at a self rev utl cuff which barely made a scrambling JO''s finger on the team made up for lost ground completing all of the necessary requirements. A side note to this was Jamie''s damaged hand from attempting so many cuffs. Swollen and bruised he carried on despite his ailment. Maybe next year he''ll have learned the subtle art of the cuff. \r\n\r\nIn first place in what amounted to a blow out were the team of Skippy Jammer, Matt Gauthier and Arthur Coddington. This team quickly dispatched of all of the necessary requirements immediately then got down to the business of shredding. A brief lull in their play prompted a time out. Skippy and Matt put on Hawaiian shirts then went back to business. The final 2 minutes of their routine were as good as any play in the history of the event. Of note is Arthur''s fine play.

It came a bit different as I thought. We prepared in time the evaluation sheets, planed the food and all other stuff what we would need for the playing location. The same with the accommodations for all players.\r\nMy trip for the weekend started on Friday the 3th of September in Duisburg/Germany. I picked up Hoon a Korean friend in Cologne and drove in the direction to Nuremberg. On the half way I got messages and calls over and over again. A few examples: Zora called me “where is the jamming location”, Fabio called me “I am lost somewhere in Nuremberg” and Michael called “where are you we are waiting to play with you”. In this situation I thought “why have I coded the event website with all the information when nobody uses it”. This was around 9 pm on the highway with 140 Km/h of speed somewhere around Frankfurt. It lasted another 4 hours till we arrived at the Weinerei … and Hoon was sleeping like a Baby. The Weinerei is a Bar for alternative people which were under construction. Some Freestylers from Berlin and Karlsruhe celebrated already a chilled party with Fabio and his brother. After one hour talking and drinking is was bedtime … around 2.30 am.\r\nThe next day we started playing around lunch time at Woehrder Wiese and a lot of more people as I thought found their way to the lovely Franken capital Nuremberg: Matthias with a friend from Berlin, Stephano and his wife, Uli and friends, the whole Frankfurt players, other players from Munich and some viewers which I didn´t contacted … wow. The place was full around 2 pm and Boris and I prepared the jamming location. Of course it lasted only a few minutes and the neighbours complained about the noise but we made some deals with them. We organised a sound system, air seats and had really luck with a perfect sunny weather. After we spoke about the rules we started round 1 at 6 pm. I played in the afternoon from time to time and practised as a whole approximately 30 minutes. Exactly like my prearrangement was my play in my first tournament in round 1 … really worse and everyone told me but we had nice weather, gladly. There were 21 Freestylers playing in round 1 and we really had to hurry because it became dark. Therefore we moved the jamming location under a street lamp what was a really nice experiment because all the people who walked by were forced to watch us playing whether they wanted or not. After that it lasted nearly two hours to do the analysis of all evaluation sheets. Another beer another piece of pizza and I was ready for Fabio`s Gitis contest. Therefore we went to a lighted passage and played with to much beer and motivation Gitis after Gitis … all of us knew after that what was a Flamingitis, Air Gitis, Normal Gitis and how it should work theoretically. The result: Fabio had after the contest nearly no voice, Urs twisted his ankle, Vanessa a non Freestyler player catched Gitis after Gitis, Laurent won the contest and everyone was totally tired. \r\nSome players who organised no sleeping place themselves spend with the people who booked the Weinerei as sleeping place the night. I think it were around 20 persons … definitely too much for that small place but it worked. I don´t know how but all came the next morning having breakfast at the Kabine our event restaurant. The first problem rose with 10 football players who spoke German with eastern European dialect using the jamming location as football place. After 10 minutes discussion we gave up arguing and stopped them playing because their keeper got confused about so many Frisbees. Round 2, 3 and 4 were without any problems … oh I forgot the police who wanted us to turn down the sound … we did till the finals and Prodigy helped Fabio, Kolja, Carsten and Laurent rocking the disc. After that we cleaned up and had dinner with beers and had to say goodbye till the next year for jam and go 2005. \r\nAll in all the event was a very good experience to come in contact with all German players and it was definitely my best Frisbee weekend up to now although I played not to much. Thanks to all who participated who contributed to the great spirit of the event … you are all invite to play with us in 2005 again. All information will be available on www.jamandgo.com and www.jamago.com.

Immediatamente vedo scatolette, colle saltar fuori dagli zaini e i più intraprendenti non volendo perder tempo si mettono a giocare senza unghie finte!\r\nLa giocata notturna al parco finisce e ci spostiamo a bere qualcosa in un locale adibito a “dormitorio” per alcuni degli atleti.\r\nSi chiacchera di tutto, con chitarra di sottofondo, un atmosfera che si trova ai ritrovi con gli amici.\r\nLa notte continua fino alla una con un’ultima jam in una vuota, ma illuminata stazione della metropolitana.\r\n\r\nFinalmente arriva Markus che porta me e mio fratello a casa sua. Si chiacchera un pò, ma dopo poco la stanchezza è troppa e si sprofonda in un sonno profondo.\r\n\r\nNORIMBERGA 4 Settembre\r\n\r\nIo e Davide ci svegliamo tardi, e fatta colazione con Markus, ci dirigiamo nel parco dove si svolgerà il torneo.\r\nLà ci incontriamo con tutti i partecipanti e rivedo Arne Bratenstain da Berlino (autore del bellissimo sito http://www.frisbee-freestyle.de/) , Mike Rausch, da Vienna e Kolja Hannemann da Berlino!\r\nPrima del torneo propongo di creare un piccolo workshop, che alla fine si trasforma in un incredibile scambio di mosse, tentativi, sorrisi e soddisfazioni da parte di tutti!\r\nIl torneo inizia e ciò che noto da subito è l’alto livello di gioco.\r\nMosse da manuale, energia e spirito di gioco fanno della prima giornata, una giornata meravigliosa, con gli ultimi shred compiuti con un sole al tramonto!\r\nUn’entusiasmante spettacolo di Frisbee-Dog eseguito da Zora e Jochen Schleicher (tra l’altro autore del sito http://www.discrockers.de/ ), grande persona e amante (come me) dei fedeli amici dell’uomo, spezza i primi due gironi, dimostrando come il frisbee in tutte queste discipline sia sempre così vicino al gioco!\r\nFinalmente inizia il party e tutti ci troviamo a chiaccherare, stanchi e soddisfatti della giornata!\r\n\r\nLa notte è lunga e propongo un Gitis Contest. Markus mi indica che il posto migliore è proprio un sottopassaggio illuminato vicino al parco. Le regole (pensate sul momento) sono: 3 tentativi di gitis normale “valore:1 punto” / 5 tentativi di gitis saltato “ valore: 2 punti” e ben 8 tentativi di flamingitis (o posted gitis) “valore: 3 punti”. Il primo posto è vinto senza ombre di dubbio da Mr. Laurent Mess con 3 gitis normali / 2 gitis saltati / e 2 flamingitis !!!\r\n\r\nNORIMBERGA 5 Settembre\r\n\r\nIl giorno dopo, stanchi ed indolenziti, ci alziamo per fare una lauta colazione e subito dopo ci sono i primi “coraggiosi” che iniziano ad allenarsi fin dalle 11 del mattino!\r\nLa giornata è fantastica, con un vento un pò instabile, ma con un cielo limpido e un’erba morbida e non umida.\r\n\r\nIl torneo riprende e i partecipanti vengono suddivisi in pools, dove saltano fuori nuove mosse ancor più complesse!\r\nDopo i round finali per i piazzamenti intermedi alla classifica segue la finale con i primi 4 che si son fatti strada tra i venti atleti: siamo io, Kolja Hannemann, Carsten Heim e Laurent Mess.\r\nIl torneo è ormai seguito da video e fotocamere di ogni genere e il tifo è alle stelle, visitatori esterni si incantano nelle ore del tramonto nei movimenti fluidi di Kolja, la forma energetica di Carsten e le prese aeree di Laurent!\r\n\r\nCome ogni bella favola, anche questa era finita, con emozioni che solo i frisbisti e coloro che li amano e supportano possono capire. Una bellissima magia che si assopisce tra gli “arrivederci”, gli abbracci e i “grazie”!\r\n\r\nIl prossimo anno io ci sarò di nuovo in quella magica atmosfera che mi ha regalato Norimberga!\r\n\r\nFabio Sanna', 'y', 'www.jamandgo.com', 'markus@jamago.com', 'Intl', 'n');

We were blessed with wonderful weather, upper 70’s on Friday and in the lower 80’s on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  121 people entered the tournament, with around 35 taking part in the freestyle portion of the event.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Laszlo’s Wienie World rocked Shelter H with their incredible brand of Southern Hospitality.  Great food and beverages all weekend long, the lounging area, live band on Sunday, smiling faces behind the counter.  If you have never experienced a VA States, there is still time to make one, like next year, or the year after, or….  Suffice to say, if you have never been, or if you have and haven’t been in a while, make an effort to go.  It is an experience you will not soon forget.\r\n\r\nFreestyle took place on Sunday.  The first round consisted of 13 teams broken up into two pools.  There was some stellar play, with all teams spurred on by the appreciative audience. The top three teams from each pool then advanced to the finals.\r\n\r\nThe Cooksey brothers started things off with a nice routine.  These guys are excellent overall players with some nice jamming chops as well.\r\n\r\nFifth place went to Harvey Brandt and Tom Lasher.  Harve and Lash played really well in the first round, but were unable to pull together all their stuff for the finals.\r\n\r\nIn fourth place came the team of Dale Crawford, Phil Kappa and Mike Mosher.  Dale and Phil have been coming to this event for years.  (They won it in 1990.)  This year they added Mike, who had a good chance at the overall crown. (Nice touch, guys.)  Dale and Phil pulled off some their patented pairs moves, and all three of the guys did some nice indies.  At the end of the day, their fourth place in freestyle vaulted Mike to the top, and he took the overall crown.  \r\n\r\nThird place went to Bill Wright and Rob Knapik.  Rob has been coming to the VA States for some time.  A local boy from Lexington, Virginia, he now lives in Ft. Collins, doing his graduate work at CSU.  Which is good for him and Bill.  Another jammer in Ft. Collins! Bill was heard to exclaim.  They played well, putting together some nice co-ops to some electronic music that mixed into a nice county thing about lovely Virginia.  \r\n\r\nComing in second was the team of Toddy Brodeur, Alan Caplin and myself.  We played well, with Toddy doing some nice Toddy-esque moves and Alan busting out some turnovers and multiple spinning catches.\r\n\r\nThis day, however, belonged to the shredders from NYC, Rob Fried, Joey Hudoklin and Doug E. Fresh.  As Fresh was heard to say afterwards, it took us seven years, and today we finally did it.  What they did was their semi-planned spontaneous stuff without missing a beat throughout the five minutes of their routine. One continues vibe of shred.  I have seen them in VA for the last three years now, and I can attest that this past weekend was indeed spectacular for them.  Grooving to the slow country sounds of their song, they flowed effortlessly throughout the routine.  Pulling off their upside down brushing sequence, speed flow, light z moves, mob-op brushing runs, highly technical individuals, they were on.  The routine ended with Joe flying through the air doing big gitis.  He crashed down to the ground, and that was that.  There really wasn’t any need to tally the scores on the sheet as the outcome had been decided then and there.  Stellar play, guys, an outstanding demonstration of freestyle Frisbee, controlled spontaneity, and all around a joy to watch.\r\n\r\nWell, that’s it for this short dash off.  \r\n\r\nReally, can’t say enough about how much this tournament rocks.  If you don’t go to Paganello next year, then VA States is for you.  (Or vice versa!)\r\n\r\nKeep on jamming.\r\n\r\nRodney', 'y', '', 'e.l.olsen@worldnet.att.net', 'US - West', 'n'),

A large audience again saw some\r\nexcellent play despite the conditions. Larry Imperiale, Dave Lewis and Clay Collera went first and despite the conditions, went for an aggressive routine. The wind bit them a bit and was a warning to the other teams to be careful. The highlight of their round was Larry’s behind the neck outer rim hover delay which lasted some 5 seconds. Up next were Jeff Kruger, Carlos "Pipo" Lopez and Toddy Brodeur. These guys played great in the conditions. Pipo is the recognized master and all three hit some strong indies. They won presentation by a good margin and fired up the crowd.\r\nThey seed busted to an impressive second place finish.\r\nUp next were Randy Silvey, Dan Yarnell and Paul\r\nKenny. Paying heed to the wind, this team played a strong game with Paul able to do some turnover stuff, Randy hitting his neck catch thingy and Dan did his goofy stuff despite the wind and a bit of a hamstring pull from the the previous night’s semifinals. This team ended up champions of the Acrobatic Paganello 2001. Sune Wentzel and Reto Zimmerman went last and played well. Sune hit a spinning scarecrow with only his thumb and index finger. Reto went for a quad spinning flamingo when a 6 spin move was called for. This Eurojammer team ended up third.\r\nThe semifinals in Altro Mondo studios was a\r\nthing of beauty. After last year when a couple teams fired up the crowd, this year all 6 teams did. The only thing louder than the thumping music was the crowd noise. It was absolutely\r\nincredible. Being in the back room warming up, I was unable to see the routines, only watching the teams as they returned from their routines. The highlights were basically 2. The first\r\nwas the roaring for Sune and Reto.\r\nYear after year, these two absolutely own the Paganello semifinals. The other highlight was Randy going on a ridiculous osis fest, clearly carrying his team. But the highlight of the evening occurred after the teams finished.\r\nWith this year’s Acrobatic Paganello dedicated to Fernando Direito, the jammers asked the audience to share a moment in his honor. A candle was lit next to his picture on the jam floor and everyone began clapping in unison for many minutes.\r\nThere was not a dry eye in the house and as I\r\nwrite this, I again well up. We will miss him, but his spirit is in all of us.\r\nThe preliminary round was played outdoors with a kind wind and everyone going off. Everyone shredded. This year’s field was very deep and it is obvious this is the tournament everyone targets.\r\nDue to a harsh overnight storm where the tides came up and literally washed away the jam\r\nsurface along with prevailing strong winds, the B-round was moved indoors. This round is where those not making it automatically to the Altro Mondo semis were allowed to again compete for 2 more spots in the night show. It was a great move as the jamming again was hot with the\r\nhighlight being Gary Aurerbach and company putting on a choreo-show that ruled.\r\nInclusive to this round indoors was the first Italian National Championships, aka the\r\nPaganello Underground. Only teams from Italy competed (5) and it was done with the same\r\njudging panel as a way to objectively evaluate them relative to the others. The play was great,\r\neveryone having fun. One of the Roman teams used 3 players and their own video camera, swapping\r\nit amongst themselves as they went through the routine.\r\nItalian jammers RULE and are seeming to be taking over!!\r\nEnrico, Lo Zio and Tommy came up with the big Italian fish and their scores would have put them\r\nin the middle of the pack in the regular round.\r\nSpecial thanks go to Clay and Lui Collera and Mimmo.\r\nThese folks spared no effort to ensure the jammers were comfortable and having a good time.\r\nThey are the reason we keep coming back. Jumpi, thanks to you and your staff for allowing us\r\nto tap into the biggest party in the world. See you all next year.\r\nCiao!\r\n-Paul Kenny', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The weather was unusally cooperative this year. Sun blazing and light, but swirling wind conditions throughout the weekend! The one hundred and ten competitors feasted at Lazlo''s Weiner World with uncomparable fare at more than reasonable prices. If you haven''t been to the largest east coast event as a competitor, you don''t know what you''re missing. The operative word is FUN and casual atmosphere. This year Sunday was graced by a live band which rocked the field throughout the afternoon. \r\n\r\nRelated to the freestyle portion of the event, several specialists showed up to strut their stuff in front of the very receptive VA crowd. There were fourteen teams and the pools were judged using a rank judging system. Time and again, judges in Virginia seem to give the nod to those top-notch presentational routines, and this year was no exception. Four females participated in the open freestyle format, in which three advanced to the seven team final round. \r\n\r\nThe appearance of two freestyle legends, Joey and Erwin made the event extra special. The preliminary rounds were much hotter than that of the finals...but certainly there were some highlights within the final round even with lower execution scores. \r\n\r\nBob, Jack and Randy had to scratch their final appearance due to a mishap suffered by Bob in the prelims. He had to be carted off to the hospital for a seperated shoulder injury. Nikki, Deanna and Richhi put on their patented presentational routine. It''s always fun to see these three hit so many standing gitises (or is plural giti?) that you tend to believe that this is their "bail" move! (Wish I had a bail move like that in my pocket!) \r\n\r\nDale and Phil dusted off their routine to show some creative co-oping. Phil had some moments of smooth disc work, while Dale displayed his powerful spinning catches. However, both had too many drops in order to seed bust beyond the 5th place spot. Erwin, Judy and Eric put some flowing co-ops together that they hit solidly from the get-go. Erwin shined and demonstrated some powerful double spinning flying catches, as well as many sweet body roll combinations. Judy threw in a few big spinning toe tipping moves along with her own big flying gitis catch. Eric was able to show some solid jam time even though he had hip replacement surgery two years ago. But too many drops plagued Judy and Eric''s performances which restricted them from breaking into the top three places. Playing next was Harvey and Tom Lasher. Tom shredded the field with many consecutive individual moves. He made the crowd roar when he hit a smoking double spinning crow catch and a very graceful combination into a blistering spinning flamingitis catch. Harvey played solidly as well with some rolling and brushing combinations to complement Lash''s power moves. This team finished with the lowest execution deductions, despite one major throw away in the midst of the routine. This team proved that you could seed bust into a finals even with the depth of talent seeded ahead of them. Finishing third was the smooth, flow routine of Doug, Joey and Rob. These veterans demonstrated what you can do with a quick exchange game which stressed speedflow and movement among its team members. All had some brillant quick catches from the other jammer''s feed. The non-stop movement made the audience marvel. However, the team hit a string of quick drops within the middle of the five-minute routine. This wasn''t a definitive loss, but they did leave the door open for a stronger routine to take the win. Having them drop one seed to finish third was a slight surprise though. \r\n\r\nA finals wouldn''t be the same without some fluff thrown into a routine and Todd, Ted and Scott didn''t disappoint. They had the live band accompany them with a rocking number. They made an untraditional entrance by driving onto the field in Todd''s very colorful frisbee van. Ted met a slight snafu when he tried to open his door only to find it locked! But the momentary hitch didn''t stop them from smiling and being the ever present showmen. The three came out and showcased a version of Ted and Scott''s simultaneously choreographed Broadway show sequences. Although the sequences weren''t laden with difficulty, they looked very visually pleasing. Then the three broke out into their individual moves and presented very athletic and consecutive combinations. Ted jammed hard and displayed his tremendous expertise with double and triple spinning catches. Todd showcased a variety of combinations long with a photo opportunity for his one-armed handstand catch. Scott showed the crowd his polished intricate consecutive moves puntuated with a big spinning flamingoasis catch. This team likewise, had several drops midway through their routine leaving the crowd scratching their heads as to whom would win the top honor since there were no clean routines presented. But the nod went to Ted, Scott and Todd and all were literally crowned victors. \r\n\r\nBriefly highlighting the overall finishers: Arizona''s Harvey Brandt captured his third VA State Open Title along with his first coveted Maximum Time Aloft M.T.A. "Mr. Bubble" title. Harvey''s acceptance speech acknowledged the fact that he was the oldest winner of the open overall title but more impressive was the win by the women''s overall champion won by thirteen year old Nikki Ross who is as distinguished since she is the youngest female winner. Nikki has matured to be a significant overall competitor winning womens golf and squeaking out Judy Robbins by 3/100 of a second to win the MTA title.\r\n\r\nJudy Robbins', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

TD Gordy Adell set everyone up at a YMCA camp in New Hampshire complete with individual cottages surrounding a picturesque lake. The tournament folks were the only residents. The communal environment with generous accomodations allowed everyone to relax and enjoy each other and the surroundings. The nights were topped off with group jams with outstanding musicians and no worries regarding acoustic amplitudes. \r\n\r\nOh yeah, and the freestyle was alot of fun too! In fact, the finals were rained out and we were forced to have them indoors after dinner and drinks a la Rimini. It led to an awesome vibe in the intimate and very playable setting. \r\n\r\nThere were about 14 teams (results forthcoming) along with (I believe) 5 amateurs competing. The semifinals were outside and all of it was completed in good winds with no rain. In fact, the rains came right after everyone finished and the judging complete...excellent timing if it were to happen. I did not know many of the teams, but there was a bunch of old crust returning. A couple were from the late 70''s era (sorry, forgot names) and knew alot of the names bandied about in Skippy''s articles. Some highlights included Greg Black''s gitis followed by him leading cheers for himself, Kraig Steffan and others doing the ultimate sacrifice and diving full horizontal for some catches...horizontal diving seemed to be a theme of the semis. At one point during one routine (to a Dead song) the power went out. The audience (at least those with skills) continued singing the song perfectly as the routine continued without hesitation...a tournament moment. Jason Southwick played awesome, cleanly doing alot of double disc rim moves from the old days. Vic Ouzoonian and Dan Berman had a nice routine put together. Steve Scannell and Rick Williams have put the pieces together for next month''s Masters, using their main skill (having a combined age over 100!) and had a great semi routine. Pipo and I had fun playing to some Santana as I double disced it a little and Pipo did his karate kid thing. Piposis rules! Scott and Toddy took over the crowd with Scott''s rangy contortions and Toddy''s facial expressions and gymnastics. \r\n\r\nThe finals were indoors and everyone played awesomely as the crowd REALLY got into it. It is clear the night howl is a fan favorite...although forcing the jammers to behave until complete!! Jason was in his element. Steve was able to do extensive juggling. Vic and Dan again played well with Dan earning a disc just for going for a roots! Pipo and I had another good jam, really firing up the crowd. We had a couple truly electric moments. We started the routine sharing a recorded phone message some New Englanders had sent me the week before. Ask any of us for an explanation...good fun. Scott and Todd came last and had an awesome routine. With a slow start and rough finish they left the door a bit open. Pipo and I won, Scott and Todd came in second and Steve and Rick third. I am not sure of the results otherwise, I just wanted to get this out to share the vibe. \r\n\r\nGordy, do it again...and for the Masters next year...you ROCK...thanks!! \r\n\r\nPaul Kenny ', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Hopefully the days of Tam Wolfe being the lone woman are behind us. \r\n\r\nAs always, the central part of the "Manresa Experience" was camping out next to the beach. The highlights of that was a midnight jam by Tommy L, Alan Caplin, Melissa Trail, Johnny O''mally and Mark Regalbuti. Another highlight was Alpha, the Jammer family dog was sprayed by a skunk during the night. It''s all just part of the experience. \r\n\r\nTournament format was 7 minute pairs routines, 8 minute Co-op routines and 5 minute mixed routines. Bonus moves (up to 5 points each) were awarded for Roll to teammates direct catch -flying gitis -scarecrow brush. Super bonus points (5 points each) were awarded for -Water Catch -Skid Row (more than two in a row) and -Bad Attitude. A single score for Difficulty was also awarded (maximum 10 points).

One thing is for sure, as Arnie says..."I''ll be back!" \r\n\r\nQuick overview:\r\nThe wind was a bit choppy so overall the play wasn''t quite as hot as day 1 but the crowd made tons of noise and the event was a huge sucess. \r\n\r\nSome jammers found the time to see some music too: including James Brown, Paul Simon and Ekoostik Hooka \r\n\r\nSo much jammin'', festin'', pubbin'', grindin''...so little time. \r\n\r\nPS I''ve your ever in Milwaukee there is a park on Lake Michigan that gets great wind and is like a cross between palm park (maples, elms and ash instead of palm trees) and La Jolla Cove. Be sure to contact Steve or R & B to set up a jam. \r\nSemi-Finals \r\n\r\nThe weather was sunny and the wind was 5-10 mph north-eastern as the Summerfest Open 2001 kicked off at the Sports Area inside the Milwaukee Summerfest. The Jammers fired up the crowd and the crowd fired up the jammers, resulting in a full day of sensational freestyle. There were around 800 spectators at one time - and several thousand viewed the event over the course of the day. The sound system was epic and the area was an excellent surface for shredding. \r\n\r\nThe first event was Mixed pairs and it kicked off with a nice routine from Erin (Scott) Waldron/Pat Marron - Pat hit several big double spinning catches and Erin showed she can still play at a high level. Next up was Anne Grave/Tommy Leitner - they played solid with only 3 drops - Anned hit a big gitis and Tommy pulled out a big tipping series. Finishing out the Mixed pairs semi was the ultra-turbo hubby/wife team of Amy B Schiller/Dave Schiller. This was their first event since the ''98 worlds where they won an unprecedented 4th consecutive world mixed pairs title. Just a hint of rust showed through but overall there routine was consecutive hein - biz as usual - the crowd went nuts as they hit big move after big move - they won the pool. \r\n\r\nThe Open pairs started within minutes of the Mixed Pairs semi...Steve Jennings kept the crowds attention with his MC skills and by doing demos in between routines. Anne & Amy went out first and played very well, they had the 2nd highest execution score of the round and squeezed into the 4 team finals with a 4th place finish. Next up was Tom Sahlit/Rik Downs - they hit some nice co-ops and Rik hit a monster and huge gitis Tom hit a sweet didge but they had a few too many drops. Mark Regalbuti/Alan Caplin, playing to ''When the Music is Over'' by the Doors, got into a groove hitting their speed flow and co-ops...Buti hit a big Phlared and Alan finished the routine with a crushing gitis - they also made the finals with a 3rd place finish. \r\n\r\nLocal favorites Matt Hughes/Brad Wendt came out with a really nice routine which had delivered a state championship title last year - but these guys had some tough wind and couldn''t seem to recover from some early drops just missing the finals cut. Pat Marron/Rico Schneider played great - with Pat hitting consecutive skid moves and finishing with double spinning catches and Rico catching lots of big air moves. They recovered well from a few breaks in flow and their strong finish gave them 2nd place in the pool. Last up was Dave Schiller/Tommy Leitner - Chillman was totally on fire hitting long combos and nailing a sick nureons to scarecrow, TL kept the flow going hitting a few nice indys...they won all 3 judging categories and will be the top seed for todays final. \r\n\r\nAll in all everybody was totally fired up to play in front of a very appreciative and vocal crowd. Buti said it was the biggest crowd he''s played in front of since 1983 Victoria Texas - here are some selected quotes from the players... \r\n\r\n"What a rush, man...I haven''t shredded like that in front of a big crowd since the Ronald Reagan Daze". Buti \r\n"The people are there, the music blares, the palat is set to blend the colors into a huge shred(noun)". Chillman \r\n\r\n"It''s the best audience at a freestyle event in the US" Anne Graves \r\n\r\n"What a party - music, jams, concerts. It''s live at Summerfest!" Tom Sahlit \r\n\r\n"I am this mystery, here we stand" Baba Rodeshe \r\n\r\n"Summer-shred Fest, So many Jams and so little time" Rico \r\n\r\n"So many players to shred with and the crowd rocks...you gotta be happy with that" Pat Marron \r\n\r\n"The hops in the air, people in the chair, the brewed of Milwaukee drink up the shred" Dude B Schill \r\n\r\n"Welcome to the Jam-shred-heino-pip-party-naturale- of the year" Cisco Kid \r\n\r\n"I was jazzed to play in font of such a loud crowd" Rik Downs \r\n\r\nAfter semis a brief rain storm interrupted the sunset jam and was followed by a magnificent rainbow over the the Lake Michigan with lightning bolts shooting through the rings. The jam park, Veterans Park, is like a Palm Park like field with low cut grass right on the water front. \r\nOther jammers in attendance but not competing: Bethany & Rodney Sanchez, Ron King, Steve Jennings, Roger Hanlon \r\n\r\nTime to rip it up one more time!!! \r\n\r\n- Tom', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We were fortunate to gather jammers from all-around the country and Canada to treat the crowd of disc enthusiasts that had gathered for the Allentown Sportsfest (of which we were a part). \r\n\r\nSince we were somewhat behind, getting through 16 DDC teams in a round-robin format, we had the seven freestyle teams do a four minute jam each, using four judges to rank difficulty, execution, and presentation. The judges were Joe Lynn, Tom Painter, Curt Davis, and John Cohn. \r\n\r\nThe event went like this... \r\n\r\nRob D''Allesandro and Ed Sinkler sucked it up for four minutes, with Ed pulling off a couple nail delays under his leg. They were mainly in the Freestyle portion to gather more overall points in the tournament, since we were awarding more points to the freestylers than the speedflow''ers. They did get things off to a nice start however. \r\n\r\nNext, Amber Hoffman and John Duesler (me) teamed up to jam. Amber is a past Junior Champion, so her execution was impressive, pulling off a bunch of between the leg catches of her completed nail delays. JD was doing some delays, tips (with knuckles, elbows, and toes), and brushwork, but couldn''t set up for at least one body roll, which he''s legendary for on the beach of Sea Isle City, NJ (FYI...he''s the only one freestyling on that beach!) He did pull off one tip and body spin to delay move, that was the most difficult thing he''d done in competition. They jammed to Elvis Costello. \r\n\r\nBob Hoffman (the eventual Overall winner) joined forces with Pete McLaughlin (Allentown local) and Shannon Winn (out of the mothballs) to perform for about two minutes. Bob was definitely cashing in some overall points; Pete was doing some delays, but Shannon was flashing back to years gone by with tumbles, between the legs delays and some really great stuff. As fate would have it, however, Shannon jammed his knee into the grass about two minutes into the routine. This effectively ended their chance. (btw...he did eventually walk out of awards ceremony on his own power, so I believe he''s doing ok!) \r\n\r\nThen the real jammin'' began! \r\n\r\nDan Berman and Tim Cohn combined (again...they also played DDC together) to put on a true freestyle exhibition. Dan was his usually steady self, showing grace, coordination, and sound fundamentals. Tim surprised the heck out of me, as he showed vast improvement over his NE performance just two months prior. He went behind his legs with delays, between his legs, and even pulled off some behind the back windmill catches to end his segments (please pardon my lack of "jammin''" terminology). They worked well together, and good luck to Tim at the WFDF Champ''s this weekend! \r\n\r\nFrom then on, it was world-class stuff all the way... \r\n\r\nIt was All-in-the-family, as Richhi Ross, Nikki and Deanna Ross took center grass to Jethro Tull''s Aqualung. They amazed the crowd, working three discs between them in a triangle. Using behind the back transfers, brushes, between the legs passing, and just a great medley of fundamental freestyle moves, they warmed up their routine. Then Deanna and Richhi fed Nikki their discs and let her go to work. Clearly, the z-machine has been doing some overtime at the Ross house, as Nikki executed a difficult routine with great maturity. I hope Deanna and Nikki stay interested for a long time, because the sky is the limit for these girls. They concluded their four minutes by huddling together and pulling off 2/3 behind the back, over the head catches (oops Richhi :-) (what''s that catch called anyway?) \r\n\r\nAnne Graves (she mentioned the jammin'' women would consider her a lucky duck for hooking up with...) and Scott Sailor then found themselves in front of the crowd with a high energy, instrumental trance tune. They started out with about 30 seconds of speedflow, but then busted out with one of the most rhythmic, beautiful routines that non-partners could muster. Anne showed us her seasoned skills and Scott combined his famous flexibility throughout the four minutes. Especially cool was the transfer Scott pulled off by lifting his right leg to his head, and tossing the disc through the bodily hoop he constructed. So nice! They also were able to do a double body roll, as Scott went from left arm to right arm, feeding Anne''s left arm and completing the roll. Again...so nice! \r\n\r\nIn fairness to Anne, she had to wait quite a while to do her 4 minutes, so I know she felt like she could have done better. Don''t fret though...she was still awesome. \r\n\r\nTo complete our field Gary Auerbach came out of retirement (thanks friend!) to hook up with Toddy Brodeur. They started spoofin'' the crowd with a neat beginning to the Cars "Just What I Needed." They worked two discs for about a minute, synchronizing counters with great catch-and-delays (not bad for about 5 minutes preparation). Then the fireworks started, as they put one of the discs to the side. Gary showed off his formal dance training with beautiful body spins, and Todd was flexing his agility with some masterful double leg unders (?) Gary was pulling off some body rolls with his back!, but Toddy really got things heated up pulling off about six consecutive front body rolls. Toddy missed his signature between the legs tumbling catch about three times, before their 30 seconds was called. Gary and Toddy ended their routine they way they began, with two discs, feeding each other overhand counters and delays until they finally met each other in the middle of the grass sitting down with their discs! Great stuff. \r\n\r\nOf all the feedback I''m getting from the OCTAD crowd in Allentown, Freestyle is being mentioned the most. Some are even telling me, "All I want to do is be able to spin that thing on my finger!" So the Freestyle seed has definitely been planted in our Eastern PA frisbee community.\r\nSpecial thanks go to Paul Kenney, Tom Leitner, and Shannon Winn for the guidance in running my first Freestyle event! \r\n\r\nJohn Duesler ', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Two other New Yorkers judged alongside him, Jason Cooper and Jill Simon (or is it Jill Hanson-Fresh?) Anyway, leading off were Seattleites Bob Boulware and John Titcomb.

We had some good speedflow until I dropped a bad attitude off Tom''s bad attitude overhand wristflip throw. Then we went full out. One of my neighbors said to me,"your partner is really good-perpetual motion man." I corrected her a little saying,"Consecutive motion man." I was a little gitis happy, but when you''re peeling why wouldn''t you be? We ended up playing about 6 minutes, mostly ripping. \r\n\r\nThen Doug E and Rob came on. As usual they pulled out smooth, flowing and airy play. Their use of space and the variety of styles they take you through is pretty amazing. Rob Fried rips with anyone, and Doug not only knows where to be, he knows how, when and what to be as well. The only drop they had that wasn''t in the hand was when Rob went for a mind blowing upside down osis pull. After that, we just jammed another couple hours, then went to the Cafe 245 for a sweet meal with homebrews. \r\n\r\nSunday was more low key. Ken could only play the reggae one day, so we plugged in Keller Williams Mardi Gras 2000 live and jammed heinously until we couldn''t play any longer. By that time Rob was injured and couldn''t play, so he filmed the jam.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

From the hosting to the jamming to an appreciative audience, the highlights were incredibly numerous. Ted Oberhaus, Scott Sailor and the Ross family snagged all the hardware, but that is only a small part of the excellence that transpired. Steve Scannell (our beloved TD) and Nicki Nicholson put on a juggling performance that was sophisticated and a joy to watch. Steve probably had the highlight of the tourney with his flying ''table top'' Bose-itis while playing with shredmeister Steve Hanes, making a return following back surgery. Steve is so awesome with his gymnastic flowing style looking sweet. Petri Isola and Alan Caplin shredded and seed busted to the finals, where they again played great. The Ross ladies themselves seed busted, shredding in mixed AND open pairs. Mark Ide was a jamming fool, displaying some old school savvy. Brad Keller and \r\n\r\nBill Dubulier had an excellent routine with a lot of speedflow components. Brad''s range of goofy throws was confusing. The Titcomb boys were in fine form, showing off the kind of air youthful legs allow for. Ted came out of the woodwork to remind us all how much work is to be done. He and Deanna Ross had a cool mixed routine if he could only do spin moves, his game would be complete! \r\n\r\nTed and Scott Sailor gave us an insider''s view of the Pucci sports routine, including handing out a ''Playbill'' of their winning performance piece (courtesy Chrissie) in the Finals (see photopoint). The routine was intense making the audience work to keep up outstanding. It is clear what is happening with Scott. I do not know how to define ''IT'', but I know it when I see it and Scott has ''IT''. His individual routine was a sheer thing of beauty. Flowing, timed, difficult, continuous, air, big seals and confident. \r\n\r\nRicchi and Nikki Ross had a great mixed routine. Both of them are growing by leaps and bounds and it showed very clearly as they took home the gold. Toddy Brodeur and Diego Gamboa probably did the most peeling. They shredded and then shredded. I was not there Thursday, but I was told Dan Yarnell was going ridiculous, leaving the other Jammers in the dust. At the tournament, it was a tossup as to whether Ted or Scott was the ultramegaheinest. On Sunday, it was Toddy. Displaying a new array of moves and seals, he is ripping! \r\n\r\nOn the social side, Steve opened his doors and the vaults. A big meal was served for the awards ceremony at the Gondola nearby with an interesting waitress experience. Nicki cooked breakfast and bagels were always plentiful. We watched a lot of videos and enjoyed the view as we listened to the ice crack on the lake. After Sunday''s mobup, we went to Toddy''s to hit the hot tub, outdoors (frozen) lakeside. \r\n\r\nSteve has a great tourney, over 20 jammers strong and growing coming from Texas to California and all over. He is ready to host the 2002 FPA Worlds as it was clear all the locals enjoyed chipping in with housing, airport runs and all the little things a TD stresses about. The freestyle faction of NEFA is a strong team capable of pulling off anything. Thanks guys and girls! \r\n\r\nSteve, thanks again for spilling your heart and soul out there for us and great jamming too!!! \r\n\r\nPaul Kenny\r\n', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Overall it was a great day of jamming and celebrating spin with a stellar group of shredaholics. Unfortunately, there was also a dose of bad news as two competitors, Mike Esterbrook and Arthur Coddington, both suffered moderate knee injuries. Both appeared to be sprains, and we all hope and pray that they will be back playing soon. \r\n\r\nOther than the knee mishaps, the fun meter was pegged most of the day. By the time I arrived in the late morning, Mark Regalbuti, Mike Esterbrook, Tam Wolfe, Alan Caplin, Doug Korns, Steve Stotter, Keith Armstrong and Dr. Bob Morrissey all had been warming up the sand for quite a while. Soon Arthur Coddington, Greg Riley, Tommy Leitner, Dave Schiller, Keith Kleiner, Scott Weaver, and Melissa Trail arrived and full-scale mobbing ensued for a couple hours. The wind was perfect in the morning, and picked up as the afternoon progressed, but it was always smooth and manageable. \r\n\r\nDuring the mid-afternoon we switched gears for a competitive round of open pairs. We had a great turnout with eight pairs on the score sheet. Each team had five minutes to shred their stuff, and we drew names randomly for playing order. Judging was as simple or as technical as each judge desired, with the ultimate score being a placement on a 1-10 scale. \r\n\r\nFirst up was long time UFOS great Scott Weaver and Bostyler Alan Caplin. They got the energy level pumped up early with some nice co-ops and Alan polishing off a diff series with a big spinning gitis. Alan played great all day. It was a real treat having him come all the way out west. Scott was working all angles and showing off his wide variety of rolls in the stiff breeze. There was no lack of diff during their five minutes, but the wind may have bit them a bit as the disc found the sand more than they liked. All in all though, a great start.\r\n\r\nNext were Buti and Keith Armstrong. Buti was in fine form all day, perhaps honed from the time he’s spent recently with a personal trainer. Keith was playing big, too. Even though he doesn’t play as much these days, he can still hang with the best. They started off hot, passing, and hitting some nice seals. They seemed unaffected by the breeze, and used it to hit some big multi spinning catches. They had the momentum going throughout and a little past midway Buti got real determined on an indy, which he finished off with a huge gitis. A very solid round by these two.\r\n\r\nThird up was the doctor, Bob Morrissey and TD, Carl Dobson. Bob got the show off to the right start early with a big indy and very nice double spinning gitis catch. Also, early on they worked in a variety of passes, brushes and shoots before Carl finished off the co-op with a double spinning flying laser. Carl managed to take advantage of the steady wind, setting out a few triple and quad spinning moves/seals. The breeze did get the best of us a few times, but all in all they had a fun round.\r\n\r\nGreat anticipation greeted our next pair featuring Greg Riley and Arthur Coddington. The World’s #1 and the marvelous flow master Greg had been shredding up to a high degree in the mob’s earlier. Infact, they seemed to have taken their games to new levels. I still was shaking my head hours later after watching Arthur take one of his patented moves to a new level. We’ve all seen him do his multi-spinning somersault move to a cool seal, but this is what we witnessed… Triple spin to a somersault to a spinning btb pull/shoot to a huge triple spinning aerial gitis. Wow. \r\n\r\nThe first minute of Greg and Arthur’s routine was superb. Big moves, nice co-ops, great flow and some huge patented seals… Greg’s big spinning Flamingitis and Arthur’s spinning crows and barrel catches highlighted the early going. But it abruptly came to a halt as Arthur planted for a move and his knee buckled in pain. He could not finish the round, and unfortunately they had drop out.\r\n\r\nAfter a few anxious minutes and a break to take care of Arthur’s knee we resumed play with another much anticipated pair. Dave Schiller and Tommy Leitner had drawn the next playing position and were fired up and ready to shred.\r\n\r\nAnd shred they did. Both are classic beach jammers, they were fully comfortable with the considerable ocean breeze, and what ensued was a clinic of huge moves, sick series and diff pass/takes. Tommy often went turbo using the wind to set out flat shoots for multi-spinning consecutive series ending in huge seals. Both were hitting brushes from all over the map; Btb’s, Crows, Bth’s, Osis, Triple fake and foot brushes during co-ops and indis. Schillman even did a little toe jammin’ early on during one of his series, which ended in a difficult fully extended double spinning aerial gitis. Tommy went off down the beach, on a run that started with a quad spinning UL, to a Triple spinning UL,  to a bad attitude shoot, to a big double roots attempt that just fell off the clampers. Over and over they demonstrated extreme prowess in beach shredding. People from all over the beach dropped what they were doing and came over to watch these two as they put on a tremendous show.\r\n\r\nSteve Stotter and Melissa Trail were up next and had the daunting task of following a massive routine. But it didn’t faze them at all as they calmly went about their business. Steve is a rollmaster of the highest order and he had his sticky front and back rolls working in the wind just fine. Melissa continues to improve and now impress with great finish moves like full-extended Bad Attitudes, flying gitis, and Scarecrows. Late in the round Steve went turbo and stuck a nice double spinning flying UL. Both looked as if they were having a great time jamming in the sand and all of us enjoyed watching them play.\r\n\r\nNext were home beach styler’s Tam Wolfe and Doug Korns. These two play Ocean Beach as much as anyone and they seemed right at home as they played smart and clean freestyle. After watching most of us struggle trying to do a bit too much in the wind, these two decided beforehand to keep it simple and build through the routine. It paid off, they played great, both hitting all their signature moves, and they hardly dropped at all. I really enjoyed their round. \r\n\r\nThere wasn’t an eighth team when we started the tournament, but because of a late appearance from Johnny O’Malley and Tom Sahlit, we were able to enjoy yet another great team performance. In contrast to the previous team these guys were determined to lay it all out from the get go and to not stop until we made them. It worked for them, too. Tom Slick left every ounce of shred he had in the sand, hitting some big series, gitis and crows. Johnny O was flying all over the beach, brushing, rolling, and attempting one of his patented aerial gitis (see the Frisbee.com photo). It was a nice routine to energize the cold judges and spectators and transition us back to the mob seen.\r\n\r\nExcept for the two knee injuries, it was a perfect day of playing, fun and disc camaraderie. We didn’t stop until sunset, and afterwards many of us enjoyed a fine Italian dinner at Pasquali’s restaurant in the sunset district of San Francisco.\r\nWish all of you could have been there to enjoy the day with us. Maybe next year?\r\n\r\nA big thanks for all who came out. Special thanks to Tommy Leitner for all the preliminary work, the great add and write-up in the SF paper, and for providing our sound system. Also to Alan and Dave for travelling far to visit us. You kicked the tournament up a few notches. Thanks', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

There was a time when there was a future for 40 molds in freestyle. Now even a 50 is lucky if it can get work. The big 80''s seemed to have all the action cornered. We could only see two of the eight pools but 80''s prevailed in them. I can really seee why some discs are so crazy for freestyle these days. Loads of z''s and hardly ever touching the ground. I talked to an 80 who had just finished a gig with Kennedy and Soto and he was still spinning. Four exchanges without a rest. Plus you can imagine what a rush it is to be turned over. The guy was speechless. Word was later that the 80 from the Basso/David routine was catatonic.\r\n\r\nSat.,Aug. 26, Cal Tech Field\r\n-a disc''s perspective-\r\n-excerpt-\r\n\r\nThe freestyle semi was excellent. An 80 came off from the Dwork/Felberbaum routine and said that he didn''t even have to fly again and he would be satisfied. There is certainly something to be said for a five-minute spin. Maybe 40''s will come back for freestyle. I''d sure love to try it. Joe played some loose golf with me on the way back to the dorm--very relaxing.\r\n\r\nSun.,Aug. 27, Rose Bowl\r\n-a disc''s perspective-\r\n-excerpt-\r\n\r\nThe freestyle was the best I''d ever seen with Corey Basso and Evan David''s 80 taking the win. They had to use a new disc in the final though because the 80 from the semi was still a bit shakey.\r\n\r\nSun., Aug 27, Rose Bowl\r\n-human perspective-\r\n\r\n-The Open-\r\nMost observers agreed that it would be a battle between Krae VanSickle and John Kirkland. Since they were teammates in both cooperative events it came down to golf, M.T.A. and Distance. Krae made his big move in M.T.A. as he took 9th and John fell to 45th. Krae also tied for second in golf and 10th in distance. 586 points of a possible 610-not bad for a kid.\r\n\r\n-International-\r\nSweden soared on the strength of Anders Svensson.\r\nFirst European to make a world final, Anders got third in a tough distance field. Canada finished second on the efforts of Gail McColl, Bill Kin, and Ken Westerfield. Japan finished a strong fourth showing great freestyle advancement.\r\n\r\n-The Women''s Division-\r\nPre-tournament favorites were Jo Cahow, Cyndi Birch and Cynthia Allen. Laura Engel must not have seen the predictions however as she came off the big winner taking Distance, DDC, Freestyle and the Open. Michele Marini stayed close right to the final day. Although she didn''t win any events, she stayed near the top in every event. By Rose Bowl day she still could have pulled into a tie with Laura by winning distance. It was not to be, however, and Laura took both distance and the title.\r\n\r\n-The Senior''s Division-\r\nTwo new faces made the senior''s race exciting. Roy Pledger of Texas and Johnny Roberts of Colorado were relatively unknown. By the end of the week both had established substantial reputations. Johnny won the senior''s world title leaving the others in an unusual four way tie for second.\r\n\r\n-The Fun-\r\nW.F.C. ''78 was certainly the most elaborately planned even in disc history. Every evening featured auctions, clinics, seminars and informal competitions. The preliminary site at Cal Tech featured a pleasant swimming pool and gymnasium.\r\n   The Sunday party included the hilarious Bill King show which got rave reviews.

The Italian team had generously sponsored by a large cothing manufacturer. Their team consisted of seven playing members and an entourage of wives, girlfriends and bambinos making a total of twelve. On Friday afternoon, the Italian team played Purley High School Ultimate Team in their sports hall. The playing area was much smaller than a full size pitch and the end zones were considerably reduced. Consequently quick movement and short passing was essential. Purley excels in both of these areas and won the game comfortably 22-11. Unfortunately two memebers of the Italian team (Renato de Chiara and Daniel Vyhnol) sustained injuries as a result of running into the walls and were unable to play on Saturday or Sunday.\r\n     The England and Italy Ultiamte match was scheduled for 2:00 PM on Saturday, April 15 and as a result of the two Italian injuries, we had to reduce the game to a five-a-side contest. We had selected twelve players for the England sid so that the maximum number of people could gain playing experience. The Italian team was forced to play the same five throughout the match; Velentino de Chiara (captain), Franco Figari, Michele Festa, Marco Vainani and Giancarlo Smurra. We started the match with the strongest England side; Andy Fletcher, Pete Wade, Andy Gravell, Ashton Moody and Stephen Swallow (captain), and built a lead of 5-2 before any substitutions were made. We substituted players into and out of the England side freely so that everyone who turned up played. At half time, the score was England 9, Italy 7. The Italian side was good in the air but they frequently lost possession as a result of wild throws. Valentino de Chiara played a crucial role in their midfield and was the most talented Italian player. During the half time, members of each team were interviewed for London radio and photographed for the Sunday Times. Keith Heatherley, our team photographer was also present.\r\n     In the second half, the England team extended their lead to a final score of England 18, Italy 9. Andy Gravell was the outstanding England player. He combined good positional sense with strong running and either scored or made the final throw for 13 of the 18 England points.\r\n\r\nThe England Players were:\r\n  Stephen Swallow, Pet Wade, Andy Gravell, Andy Fletcher, Richard Hicks, Nick Way, rodj Tilson, Astan Moody, Nick Cash, Allan Thomas, Ron Huggins and Jeremy Way.\r\n     In the evening the two teams visited a local restaurant where a rather confused Indian gentlemen attempted to serve eithteen rather hungry disc players with eighteen different sorts of curry and make sure that everybody got the right meal. Before leaving , we aranged to meet in Hyde Park at 2:00 PM on Sunday to Freestyle and exchange playing ideas.\r\n    The meet in Hyde Park was arranged to coincide with the regular Sunday meeting of the Ally Pally Tossers whose club includes Nick Sharland (1976 champion), Robe Howe (1977 champion), Les Bryant (354 foot throw, unofficial), Steve Hurrell (UK Distance record holder) and Ron Huggins (UK M.T.A record holder).\r\n     The meet featured another Ultiamte game, Guts games and a lot of Freestyling. The Italians have not really done much Freestyle although Valentino had a few intersting moves. I hope that by the time we visit Italy there will be a few Italians with a nail delay down.\r\n     The UKFA has arranged a return visit to Italy on July 24-31, 1978. We hope to have some sponsorship for the visit. Everyone who took part enjoyed the Italian visit. We look forward to regular international Ultimate play particularly against the Swedes. The UKFA will shortly be recognized by the English Sports Council. This should help considerably in obtaining funds for such visit.\r\n\r\nphoto; Ultimate competitors', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Two players, Barry Gill and H. B. Clark are the only ones who can say they have been to all 29 tournaments!\r\n\r\nBeing an overall tournament with an emphasis on disc golf the competitors were split into amateur and open groups. Amateur freestyle started on a sunny Saturday at 9:30 with the grass still wet with all the rain that Hurricane Ivan dumped on the area the day before. There were 12 two player teams! For most teams it was basic throw and catch with some speed flow thrown in by the more experienced teams. The highlights were players who dove for their catches and slid sideways with water and wet grass cuttings spraying in the air to be backlit by the morning sun.\r\n\r\nOpen freestyle prelims occurred shortly after the ams with 4 two player teams entered. The first team was a pair of guys who were interested only in gathering overall points and I must confess that I do not remember their names. Jeff Soule and Greg Clement played next and though they do not have much experience they seemed to be having a great time. Both competed last year with Jeff and his partner coming in 3rd and Greg and his partner coming in 5th. Next up were those perennial favorites, Barry Gill and H. B. Clark. These guys are practitioners of ''old school'' freestyle complete with speed flow, delays, tips, rolls and even barefoot toe throws - all done with about 2-3 times the distance apart than you would see at most freestyle events. Even though Barry needs hip replacement surgery he did very well for himself and H. B. was his usual steady self. The last team was Steve Scanell and Rik Downs. Despite Steve having a torn quadriceps muscle and Rik''s tendency to do horribly in competition this crusty team shredded! Steve, being calm and cool, completed combo after combo with plenty of diff with only a few drops while Rik played out of his mind and was later heard to say he felt like there was nothing he couldn''t do and he had only one drop! (Really!)\r\n\r\nThe finals were held on Sunday and in many ways were fairly anticlimactic when compared to the prelims. Three days of heavy jamming had its affect on Rik and he couldn''t repeat his previous day''s success and while doing well had quite a few drops. Otherwise, everyone else seemed to do as well as the previous day and the final results were the same as the prelims.\r\n\r\nAfter the finals the real fun began. A mob-op consisting of Ron King, David Kessler, Anne Goh, Brian Bohannon, Barry, H. B., Steve and Rik fired up and jammed at a high level for a few more hours. Like most post-event jams everyone brought out their "A" game. David played better than I have seen him play in a long time and despite having debilitating back surgery several years back Ron jammed great! Anne has really come a long way and can pretty much jam with anyone. When she perfects a level delay she will be awesome! Steve was impressed with the quality of play - so much so he wants to return next year and bring others with him. Perhaps now the world will realize that there is freestyle to be had in the mid-U.S.!\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately, two of  Tennessee''s best Gary Edge and Willeye Williams could not make it.

But the nucleus of the Virginia States, and what makes it stand out from other events, is Laszlo''s Wienee World. Although I''ve never seen him nor met anyone who has, Laszlo Pasteque puts out the greatest spread of healthy food and good cheer of any establishment around.

Ted Oberhaus and Larry Imperiale totally shredded to win the pool. \r\n\r\n With the wind starting to gust from all directions and the sun about 45 minutes from setting, the stage was set for another Virginia State finals. Even Laszlo''s seemed to shut down for a while as our hosts pulled up their chairs to watch the jam. \r\n\r\n As the first few groups played, it was clear the best jamming had already happened that day. Playing early, Arthur and Chuck played reasonably well given the conditions, with Arthur pulling off some incredible moves that demonstrated his command of the disc in adverse conditions. \r\n\r\n The second to last routine of the day and the best of the finals was Judy/Jeff/Toddy, as they finished to huge cheers from the crowd. (Jeff informed me later that the cheers were recorded into their tape, but regardless, they were still hot). \r\n\r\n Finally it was time for the final team, Larry and Ted. One prophetic Laszlo employee was overheard saying in the prelims that Larry could probably play by himself if the wind was good. As it turns out, Ted slightly (hopefully) twisted his knee in the prelims and scratched from the finals. So Larry went out solo (a la Randy Silvey - early 80''s, Boulder), but conditions were not like the prelims. \r\n\r\n Congratulations to Judy who comes away with another Virginia State Open Freestyle title, and to Jeff and Toddy who win their first. Originally, it was announced Arthur and Harvey had tied for overall with Chuck third. Harvey continues to amaze with the consistency of his overall performances. Arthur, after scratching from Golf, only went on to finish 3rd in Distance, 2nd in Freestyle, and 1st in MTA. Not bad for a freestyler. But when the smoke cleared and freestyle points confirmed, the Overall Winner was Jeff O''Brien, with strong finishes in all events, including a first in freestyle. Arthur was second, Chuck third, and Harvey fourth.\r\n\r\n The last time we saw Arthur, he was scratching his head trying to figure out whether Larry gets bonus points in the FPA ranking system for beating his own partner·\r\n\r\n Larry won the Team Banzi Award (in memory of Pryor Hendrix), maybe for his solo freestyle performance, or maybe because he made the distance semis for his first time in his life with the infamous Fred Flintstone shuffle-step run-up. \r\n\r\n Thanks to Eric Olsen and the gang from Laszlo''s for another great event that seems to bring back memories of tournaments from the early days of the sport. If you''ve never been, it''s definitely an early season event that shouldn''t be missed.\r\n\r\n Harvey was also overheard saying, " I relish Laszlo''s lunches. And all too soon it will all be over and we have to wait another year for our fix. So it goes, and real soon."', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Then a few blips at the end heading back into their choreography seemed to throw them a little before hitting a sweet set of ending co-ops.\r\n\r\nPat has always been a highly skilled player but in the last few years his game has an  added edge that wasn''t there before.

The skies were blue and the weather turned cooler after a stifling week, but the winds started to blow, and blow.... \r\n\r\nThe event was two rounds with six teams playing in both rounds. The site was in Battery Park, which is in lower Manhattan, near the ferry out to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The first round was ordered randomly with the second seeded by results of the first round. \r\n\r\nIn the first round the team of Meier & Simon edged out Kenny & O''Brien in a surprisingly well played round considering the extreme winds. Meier & Simon has fewer drops with O''Brien and Kenny providing some of the hottest moves with Paul Kenny''s scorching turn-overs and Jeff O''Briens technical work. \r\n\r\nThe winds did not die down for the second round, if anything they got stronger and gustier. O''Brien and Kenny played well again in the \r\n\r\nsecond round, but were not able to seal with as much consistency as in the first round, leaving the door open for Meier & Simon. Playing in the strong winds Meier & Simon started very conservatively and were dropless through half the routine. Towards the middle of the routine they started to rev up the moves a bit as their confidence was rising and Roger hit a few double spinning catches and Doug did his turbo hein pull outs to Lacers and the like. A few spontaneous co-ops (all planned co-ops were shelved given the extreme winds) worked well and they finished with two drops. \r\n\r\nThe other teams had more trouble with the winds with a close finish for third and fourth places, and the last two teams were very brave local players, most in their first tournament. Jill Hansom is Doug''s wife and played with Roy (I do not know his last name) a local jammer and they hit some nice spontaneous co-ops. Jill deserves extra credit for playing with a broken toe. Richie and Bill had some of the best moves of the day with Richie doing a lot of vertical work in the strong winds and Bill hitting a lot of great rim work. Alan and Walter played well with Alan hitting a crashing spinning behind the back catch in each round and Walter providing the move-du-jour (see below). Avi and Scott, local jammers both did some nice work, with Scott playing on an injured ankle. \r\n\r\nOne of the moves of the day was a huge flip catch by Walter (I am not sure of his last name) resulting in an enormous thud right onto his back (holding onto the disc). Ah but to be young again..... \r\n\r\nBrad Keller did a good job providing a nice field and a good sound system. Brad injured his ankle and was unable to play but seemed to enjoy the day and should be proud of putting on a nice event.

At the 9:00a players meeting Matt and Steve thought it was the perfect time to start a jam. In the middle of the announcements Steve deflected (kicked) the disc into a golfers ear. This guy had no idea what happened and he was ready to brawl. Fortunately Steve''s practice apologizing paid off and the golfer let him off easy...or so Steve thought. Later in the day during the distance competition the golfer''s buddy took his revenge with a killer drive right into Steve''s leg. \r\n\r\nLuckily the rest of the weekend was a blast! The wind coming off the river Saturday was near perfect and Jake, Matt, Steve, Bob and Sarah had no qualms taking advantage of it. They hit combo after combo including one with a flamingitosis brush by Matt. As the day went on the jam grew and shrank as a few of the overalls players stepped in to test their skills. Another notable aspect was the beer and barbecue provided for the players. Special thanks to Full Sail for being the biggest sponsor of the event. \r\n\r\nSunday was the day of the freestyle competition. With the other events running late it was decided at the last minute to do a single pool using peer judging based on difficulty (Skippy style). There was a great turnout of non freestyle who wanted to give it a run and we were impressed by all of them. Adam, Blair and Seth decided to take the comedy route. Almost every catch was a layout. Man was it fun(ny) to watch. Sadly their diff score was below 1. Pat and Dan hit us with a good variety of throws and some nice tips. Spider and Ent pulled out some very unique moves. With a slowly spinning disc Ent pushed down hard and turned his hand over to gain control. He did this over and over under the leg, behind the back and ended with a perfect set (to a drop) to his partner. Qxhna carried the team of Bart, Randle and Qxhna . They managed to feed her spin and she''d work her magic with utl passes to beautiful chairs and flamingos. If only someone could have given Bart a good counter toss he would have broken loose as well (but not like Qxhna ;-). James and Sten-erik are Portland-ites and have dabbled in freestyle in the past. At one point they had a wonderful rhythm of speed flow which could easily be called the best speed flow on the field of the day. The change from throw to catch was expertly consecutive. John and Cliff appeared to have the most choreographed routine of the day even though they only spent 3 minutes preparing. They had beautiful passes and a great sequence of turnovers. Some actually commented on how well they ''spoke the freestyle language'' on the field. Rhore, Vehro and Sarah shredded with multiple gitus moves. Rhore almost pulled off a phlaud set to a phlaud take. Xten and Zalen tore up the field setting the standard for the next two teams. They hit some nice reverse sets, then Zahlen took off on a brushing combo that ended in a text book china syndrome. Bob and Getty hit some stuff. What can I say, I didn''t see it but it must have rocked because Jake and Matt only beat them by .3. Rumor has it Getty caught the teams first aerial gitus to which Bob answered with a planted flamingitus. Jake and Matt got hot to take the tournament. Their multiple reverse combos and flowing passing sequences were second to none. Plus Matt sacrificed his body landing on his head to catch a barrel roll. Poor Steve''s car supposedly broke down and he went home before the competition. I think he was scared of the golfers. \r\n\r\nOver all this tournament was an all around good time. Special thanks to all those who helped put it on and all the freestylers who traveled from out of town to help make the freestyle a powerful event. We turned some heads.

Great weather, great crowds, kind winds for the most part and a great jam and crowd response at the Jaguars game. BTW, the Jammers helped the Jags to a big win! This tournament would not have been nearly as smoothly run without the enormous help provided by Tommy Leitner. Taking the bull by the horns, he covered some bases overlooked by the TD and truly made things happenÉthanks Tommy, you are one of a kind. Special thanks to Bob "Friz" Coleman who came late to enjoy the show and provided awesome announcing which really worked well with the busy pep rally crowd. Thanks Friz! Major kudos go to Carl Emerson who quietly and with joy, provided a rental truck, manual labor and a tournament banner with the tourney logo which was all first class. Carl is Top Shelf and without him I would have been helpless. \r\n\r\nThere was so much hein jamming, especially in the semis. With an extremely deep field providing a very competitive and fired up backdrop, the show was awesome. Jammers from Puerto Rico, CA, CO, MA, KY, CT, PA, FL and TX traveled in to rock the Jax world. Tommy and Murf just peeled. Hos convoluted and Pipo Pipo''d. Jeff O''Brien had probably three or four moves of the tournament. Steve Scannell''s arrival signaled the return of the traditional mystery jammer. \r\n\r\nA very tasty mixed field impressed an audience not aware of just how awesome these ladies can peel. Anne played with savvy from jamming so much. Nicki continues to improve greatly, impressing even those of us who have recently seen her. Renee just knows how to play, continuing her growth. But clearly the highlight of the mixed field was Nikki. She just plays with a very comfortable spirit and is open to new ideas and able to execute them immediately. Ricchi, she is a FREESTYLER!!!! All those other awards and victories are just stuff!!! \r\n\r\nThe open finals saw the winds pick up a bit. With some tents in the wind line, extra care was needed. All four teams came out shredding with everyone hitting their best stuff. The cleanliness of the routines were the difference as it might have been impossible choose otherwise. \r\n\r\nOn the injury front, it seemed with everyone going for it, a few bumps and bruises occurred. Tommy bonked his head and got a neck stinger on the last catch of their finals routine. Buddy "Hammerhead" Adams separated his shoulder, went to the hospital, then got up first thing the next morning and jammed! It seemed only Murf escaped any tweaks, even going for his famous flipÉ \r\n\r\nThose qualifying for the Jags demo included Nikki, Anne, Tommy, Murf, Larry, Paul, Gregg, Pipo, and Toddy and Buddy. Because of Tommy''s injury, he laid out of the demo and Murf and I mutually concluded Carl most deserved the opportunity to replace him as the "winner" of the most Jammer spirit. The demo went awesomely. A great wind, huge crowd and playing to U2''s "Desire" (Irish band, more tributing to Jim), everyone peeled. Murf and Laerbs especially seemed to get the fans rocking. As we left the field, there was an awesome roar from the fans which cemented the sense that we all were having the times of our lives. \r\n\r\nWe love you Jim!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nThanks again to everyone who came in for the jam. It is because of the kindness, heart, skills and friendships of you all that this event happens. \r\n\r\nHere are some quotes from the players.... \r\n\r\n"Estoy boracha J thank you pipo for jamming with meÉ you are AWESOME! And for once we didn''t have any tropical storms at the Jammers J - Renee \r\n\r\nBig Wind. Big Players. Big Quad Gitis. Big Fun. "Big Uggo" Hos \r\n\r\nFirst it''s the Friendships, then it''s the Tournament. The weather seems to not matter as much as the Fun. Carl & Michele \r\n\r\nOnce again,I could not (shoulder) the burden alone!!!! Buddy Adams " HammerHead" \r\n\r\nJax is the max, Fun is the bun, Jam as to slam, I love to show the goods when I''m livin in the hood. Toddy \r\n\r\nWinds were a little narll , but that didn''t stop O''Brien and Pipo from shredding. The move of the tourney was a gitis brush into a gitis catch. But when the winds really kicked up it was Pipo who raged. Nice play by all the players and hangin'' with everyone is what it''s all about anyway. : ) heindiego \r\n\r\nThis tournament gets better every year. Pipo \r\n\r\nPaul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, He picks you up at the airport, He lets you stay at his house, He never runs out of almond-flavored tequila, And, finally, he keeps the hurricanes away.

Since 1991 Santa Cruz has hosted 5 Beach Classics, 5 Tampico Opens, 2 FPA World Championships (''94, ''99), one WFDF (''91) and now one Manpico Open...that''s 14 events in 10 years - woohoo! \r\nBob Boulware and the Hubbards came early and camped out with me thursday night. It''s so great to have an extra day to setup camp and be able to chill out before the event. The weather was the warmest we''ve ever had at Manresa - it hit 88 at the beach and a record 100 degrees just 10 minutes inland at Watsonville. \r\n\r\nFriday morning more jammers started showing up and there were several hot beach jams friday. During one of the jams a Dolphin jumped out of the water and into an on-coming wave right in front of where we were jamming - it was awesome! By friday night both camp sites were packed with jammers - and we got to enjoy one of Boulder Creek Brewery''s finest beers, Redwood Ale. Later we headed down to the beach for a full moon beach hike and jam. \r\n\r\nSaturday everybody beach jammed and jammed and jammed from 11-4pm then we had a quick judging meeting and skippy explained the bonus and super bonus moves. The pairs routines were 7 minutes long and each team was given 1 timeout they could use whenever they needed...Almost every team used their timeout but for different reasons - to change the music, get an attitude adjustment or to find a disc that had been lost in the surf. \r\n\r\nThe first team up was Mark Regalbuti and Sandy Kelp. They played great with Buti nailing a big flying phlaud to secure extra bonus points on the final move. Next up was Matt and Jake - these homeboyz fired up big time - hitting sick combos all the way through...wait until you see this on video! \r\n\r\nMike Esterbrook and Paul Klimek came up next and Paul wasted no time hitting a crushing c&b (crash&burn) gitis on his first move - I didn''t seem him do it but I heard the crash and looked over to see him grovelling in the sand with disc in hand. Farmer Mike hit an sweet double spinning flamingo at the end of their routine. Skippy Jammer and Bob Boulware were next and they hit some huge co-ops and some techno-turvey indy''s Bob was quoted as saying jamming on the beach was like a "full serve air bush buffet". \r\n\r\nCarolyn Yabe teamed up with Melissa trail and they flowed through their routine nicely with Melissa hitting some cool air brushes and Carolyn going off on some consecutive indys. Doug Korns and John Titcomb played next and both showed how much they''ve improved over the summer. Doug did not shy away from the water and earned his new nick name, "Otter". John continues to work on all aspects of his game including both spins whether delaying or brushing the disc. \r\n\r\nTom Sahlit and Mike Cloud came out next and these guys showed what they''re all about...shredding! Tommy is playing better than ever combining technical moves with athletisism and Mikey was solid as usual, he got really fired up by the String Cheese Incident song they were playing to. \r\n\r\nJohnny O''mally and Tam Wolfe hooked up and put on quite a show. Tam has a really good understanding of how to set good angles for her partner and she gave JO some sweet sets. Johnny once again hit the water move of the tourney - he completely extended his body to reach a gitis he had no business getting to in the first place and of course he got it - right before the wave hit him (or was it vise versa). \r\n\r\nThe final Open Pairs team was counter wind Gods, Larry Imperiale and Steve Hubbard. These guys flat out ripped! Once again you''ll have to consult the video for this one...it was just off the scale. But in the end Matt and Jake took the title - congratulations boys! \r\n\r\nThe Co-op finals were held on Sunday and like Saturday the play was inspired even though the wind was lighter than usual. First up was Matt & Jake Gauthier teaming with Skippy Jammer. What a thrill for the G-Bro''s to hook up with Skippy for an eight minute routine. It almost goes without saying - these guys shredded...the Boys really got Skippy fired up - he hit some ripping against combos and a ''2 week long'' vacation. They tried increasing their gitis ratios but a few too many found sand not skin. \r\n\r\nJohn Titcomb hooked up with Johnny O''mally and Mark Regalbuti for another fun round - they hit some really nice co-ops and benefitted from a music change to the Doors during a time out. Tom Sahlit and Mike Cloud teamed with Melissa Trail and they played really well together with Melissa hitting a big water move. ''Otter'', Mike and Tam played like they''ve been playing together for years...oh yeah, they have. Otter returned to the water time and again as if he was looking for nice kelp bed to hang out in. \r\n\r\nThe final team was Steve Hubbard, Larry Imperiale and Paul Klimek. And after seeing Skippy and the G-bros shred they knew they would have to raise their games to the next level to have a chance to win...They started a bit slow, and when Larry went off on a brushing run but couldn''t save the disc because he was wearing shoes, so he decided to call timeout. He took off the shoes and from then on they raised their level of play and began hitting on all cylinders - just phenomenal to watch. \r\n\r\nSo the power clocksters couldn''t muster enough mojo to keep Larry, Steve and Paul out of the winners circle. \r\n\r\nZach Hubbard then finished the tournament off by demonstrating all the moves he''s been learning - nice job ''Zacharia Zachypoe''! \r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulations to Matt and Jake on their 2nd straight win. And kudos to Paul Klimek on his first freestyle win and to Steve Hubbard for his first win in...well, too long. Mark Regalbuti won the Most Valuable Jammer prize and was awarded a Derek Jeter bobble head doll.

This meant that players from Roma, Triesta, and some of Romagna, Veneto and Torino''s players did not attend. \r\n\r\nIn spite of it, the numbers of players surprised us, and their determination as well. First, the players from Lecce traveled twelve hours north across Italy to take part in the tournament. The long drivee was a good choice. Ramon galliani, Carlo Perrone and Angelo Mancarella had participated at Paganello as Intermediates. At Vagolino, all three made the finals. And the 4° player from Lecce, Cristina Nicolardi, participated in a nice "sensual" pair, with his girl partner Elena Dal Gesso from Milan. \r\n\r\nAlso, the guys from Roseto Degli Abruzzi showed their loyalty to Vagolino, a tournament full of meanings. Over the past years, Vagolino was the start of their freestyle adventure. Danilo Torzolini, Emidio Prosperi and Andrea Stazi gained the final, with Danilo and Emilio taking 3° place. They confirmed their important role in Italian freestyle. \r\n\r\nThe "discovery" of the year is the Veneto Region. Damiano Basso finally exited from his shell and took part in a competition. Other Bassano (a city in Veneto Region) shared the Vagolino experience. The youngest of them, Enrico Stocco, has shown his capability. Paolo Papini played with Damiano in Pairs. Davide Battaglia partecipated to the "only for fun" co-op. All impressed us considering that they are brand new players. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot of very young Milan guys, but also a new-entry from Forlì. Riccardo Bovicelli comes from the "Gaddoz''s school", so we expect a lot of surprises from him in the near future. \r\n\r\nBologna made its official debut on the Italian freestyle map: Andrea Poli and Manuel Cesari showed us the style from Emilia, and came to represent a group of about 8 players. The Bolonnaises animated Vagolino, not only with their game, but also with the fun that they have for genetic mystery. \r\n\r\nThe youngest competitor? Ale Collerà. With his 13 years (and half, like he want to precise). He stepped the green carpet, in his first official tournament. Son of a champion, with a full respected master from whom he takes the spin. The master may teach him, but he has his own style. Now he has set the stage for playing in other tournaments with other players. We said there were a lot of Milan players. A lot of brand new players from Monza too, other then the "same" big Monza names. Milano confirmed itself the centre of Italian freestyle with the highest number of players, followed by Rome. \r\n\r\nSpecial Mentions: \r\nSilvia Caruso has nerves to sell: in few time she learned a lot and her wish and constant training will be prized soon. \r\nA very fascinating routine from Giovanni Coppo and Valerio Occorsio that in Semifinals surprised us for the flow and a great cooperated game. Probably one of the most loved team also from the crowd. \r\nClay Collerà and Matteo Gaddoni placed 2°; a final with some much error, but an excellent difficulty level. \r\nWithout argue the 1° place of Andrea Meola and Antonio "Piccio" Cusmà: the feeling between them his growing day by day, and their style, lightly "Silvey Oriented", has a lot personal touch: great the performance and great the catches that have a good synchro with the music. No doubt Andrea and Piccio are one of the most exciting Italian pairs. \r\nTournament has been very nice, busy but relaxing, without stress and with a concentrated judges board. 2 pool of 10 and 9 teams, with 10 teams in the finals. \r\nOn sunday, beyond the open finals, there have been an only-for-fun CO.OP, with hat teams, random music and a lot of self-humor. \r\nProbably seeing play teams with Greas music has been one of the funny and teasing moment of the weekend: but Vagolino have on his side the skills to let us live in a party atmosphere, relaxed, friendly like no other tournament can do. \r\n\r\nVagolino is a must: the plus (if there was need to) for most of the competitors, has been the possibilitiy to try their routines and test the "carpet", looking for the next European tournament. \r\n\r\nBy Lui (translated by Damiano Basso)', 'y', '', 'carlo.cusma@ libero.it', 'Intl', 'y'),

Skippy Jammer and Tommy Leitner had a great start with smooth and flowing skid passes and multiple spinning catches from Tommy. Once the disc got wet and sandy, they lost their momentum. Arthur Coddington and Clay Collera had some momentum until they both caught water catches a third of the way into their six minutes. After that, they carried around what felt like 20 extra pounds of water in their clothes and didn''t quite have the pep they wanted.\r\n\r\n- How powerful is a triple spinning gitis? Powerful enough to move Joel Rogers and Z Weyand into the top 3. In the last minute of their time, Joel fired off a very casual triple spinning gitis. Until then, they had scored pretty standard gitis bonus points. Joel''s move may have raised their score over Lorenzo Apriani/Jan Soerensen.\r\n\r\n- The random draw didn''t like Lorenzo Apriani and Jan Soerensen. They drew the first playing position both days. \r\n\r\n- Alessandro "Sleepy Jammer" Collera made his United States competitive debut. He was on fire for the first minute of his jam with Dan Burke. Ale hit a huge, definitive Scarecrow and nailed combo after combo until the sand took over their disc. \r\n\r\n- Fabio Sanna did two standing gitis pulls; almost every catch had at least two spins.\r\n\r\n- Jamie Chantiles and Carl Dobson were on the hunt for a solid gitis for their whole six minutes but didn''t hit the triples they wanted.\r\n\r\n- Despite cackles from certain male freestylers, Eleonora retained her dignity and did not go for a water catch.

It was held at a Brockton Massachusetts Middle School Gym. We were all happy to see everyone again. The boys (X man) and girls(Nikki) world JR champs were both there along with sibblings and local wiz kid Tim Cohn. I must say the future of the sport is looking very bright. Pipo flew in from PR, Alex from Toronto with Scott Sailor and Brad Keller from NY along with most of the locals. We had lots of snow on Friday night. It was difficult for the folks who had to drive. For example Richie Ross and family drove all the way from Penn. They were going to turn around several times but they didn''t. The NYers had a nasty drive too, and the Titcomb''s bus was delayed overnight. The tournament went on as planned. 18 or so players. It just goes to show you all these Freestylers are hungry and hardcore. \r\n\r\nPetri "the dish" Isola was the jammer of the day. He hit almost EVERYTHING!!! Double this, triple that, simply on fire. I think he was highly inspired by his own cheering section. Nikki Ross was in top form as female jammer of the day. \r\n\r\nWe need to have tournaments to get Jammers together in one place to share and celebrate the art of Freestyle Disc. Steve hosted everybody back at his place for an outstanding awards dinner. Downstairs the days the video was on as players watched and heckled others. Many laughs.As people slowly left we watch last years Rimmini video. Pipo narrated. \r\n\r\nSunday was a pure 3 hour mob-op. 14 players, More jamming on Monday. Results to follow. Who cares who won!

Today, the Wintertime Open rang in the 21st century with a big rainstorm and massive performances by all the freestylers. \r\n\r\nThe biggest story was the turbo factor. The competition was in fact almost an afterthought as there were continuous mob-ops and jams in the rain all afternoon. At one point, one group seemed have fifteen players scurrying and slipping around the field. \r\n\r\nSeveral golfers bailed out of the freestyle competition, leaving three teams willing to brave Pasadena''s cold, gusty and rainy weather. The players elected to play a shortened, one round, three minute routine format. Playing order was random. \r\n\r\nPeter Laubert and Anne Graves played a very clean routine to music from the TV show ER. Their clampers were on. They passed the disc well in unpredictable conditions. Peter snagged a great spinning rain scarecrow. The team ended solid by transitioning from Peter''s patented backroll/juice directly into a gitis by Anne. They put in a winning routine and challenged the other teams to outdo them. \r\n\r\nMatt Gauthier teamed up with newly unretired player Carl Dobson and enjoyed a nice gap in the rainstorm. Carl stepped away from the sport for 15 years. Now that he''s back, he should be a solid addition to teams with his consistent against moves, turnovers and double spinning catches. The rain affected Carl in the competition and he dropped a few more than he wanted to. \r\n\r\nIn three minutes Matt Gauthier caught more gitises than all his mob-opping partners caught the entire day. Matt has been working all winter on his already formidable game. He is stringing together huge technical combos and finishing them with very physical and dynamic catches. The conditions forced him to hold back on his biggest moves, but those who saw him in Santa Monica on Saturday can testify to his elite level of play. \r\n\r\nDave Lewis, Dave Murphy and Arthur Coddington played last as the rain returned. Bad footing had the potential to really undermine all three players'' games, which are dependent on quick reflexes. They started slow, testing the waters with a co-op and a few solid indies. Things seemed okay so they turned on the afterburners. They continued to co-op and got more aggressive on their indies. Murf hit an around the world tooth delay, a big ground roll combo and to the terror of his teammates went for and hit his trademark gitis roll in the slick conditions. Arthur hit a 1080 under the leg pull and a spinning tumble combo. Dave got a 1080 legover pull, a 720 barrel catch and later sealed a phlaud off a pass from Murf. To end the round, Arthur shot a rim guide to a crash and burn gitis by Dave. \r\n\r\nThere are rumblings of a renovated playing field for the 2001 Wintertime Open, which could revolutionize the level of play at this tournament.

Then add a thousand ultimate players from all over Europe, 99% who are totally enthusiastic about freestyle. Don''t stop there, how about a flat wooden platform placed on the beach in front of bleachers for the audience. Why not cover the platform with a red carpet? OK, before we begin the competition, why not serve up free pasta from 8:30pm to 3:30am continuously the night before the for all the players - and while your at it throw in 8 HUGE 30 gallon bottles of locally grown Vino. Music? What about 2 sound systems on the beach pumping out dance music all night and into the morning. Might as well throw in a few fireworks, then a few more, then more and more and after a half hour of spectacular fireworks why not have a finally that would only be rivaled by a 4th of July show in the States. \r\nThe Competition \r\nAre you ready to jam yet? \r\nThe first round ran smoothly except for a player or two showing up late. In fact one player didn''t even show up for his round. But this tournament was about promoting the sport of freestyle not about worrying about disqualifying any teams. The crowd on Good Friday was not a big as the subsequent rounds but they were still very vocal and numbered around 200-300 spectators. \r\n\r\n Pool A - Friday \r\nAnne Graves (San Diego, CA) and Dan Mangallenese (Seattle, WA) kicked off the event with an nice routine and very high execution. The crowd was fired up as dan hit a nice phlared and Anne didn''t hold back on her brushing moves. Carlo - Franc. and Aless (Italy?) were next, followed by Steve Scannel and Nicky Mying (Boston, MA) who started their routine by juggling 3 discs each by themselves and back and forth together - very nice work. Steve played well and Nicky keeps improving more each time I see her. \r\n\r\nNext up was Juro "Chorche" Turan and Andrej "Newnew" Turan the Slovakian champions. They must have been watching some good videos because they not only have learned to do a variety center and rim combos they can also air brush extremely well. Juro hit a really nice spinning laerbs kick into a big catch. Paul Kenney (Jacksonville, FL), Larry Imperiale (Evergreen, CO) and Sune Wentzel (Norway) jammed hard and hit some excellent moves, Larry''s game wasn''t with them 100% on this day though as they took second place in the pool, although that was enough to earn them a spot in the semis. \r\n\r\nThe last team in pool A of the prelims was the all Euro team of Jan Ekman (Sweden), Reto Zimmerman (Switzerland) and "World Freestyle Challenge" director, Lui e Clay (Rimini, Italy). These guys flat out peeled! The crowd went nuts and so did the judges - they were all over the platform and off it onto the soft sand hitting big move after big move. They won the pool securing the other spot in the semis. \r\n\r\n\r\nPool B - Friday \r\nI didn''t get to see all the teams play because I was playing in Pool B. Fernando, Lor., and Andrea (Rome, Italy) were the elder masters showing excellent skills and embarrassing some of the female viewers with their ''bikini'' style. Fernando, I believe has been air brushing since the 1970''s in Rome - where he had thought he had invented it until this weekend. One of the brightest young teams was the team of Morgan, Enrico and Lor (Italy). These guys are all in their early twentys and are all excellent wind players. Enrico, "Euro Leitner" as some were calling him because of the long hair, played the counter wind game as if he had been cloned from Larry Imperiale''s fake nail. Morgan may have been the most athletic of them all - he''s clock and he hit a soccer-style flipping bicycle laerbs kick brush that was out of this world - while we were jamming on the beach. If he spends the time to learn the basics of freestyle he could be one of the best in a couple years. This team seed busted right into the semis, taking 2nd place in the pool. I didn''t get a chance to see Blazs, Orosz and Rohre Titcomb (Seattle, WA) play but I''m sure the crowd loved their charisma and skill. \r\n\r\nDan Yarnel (Fort Worth, TX), Jeff Kruger (Seattle, WA) and Tom Leitner (me - Santa Cruz, CA) hit lots of crowd pleasing moves securing 1st place in the pool. The last team to play was Cindy Kruger (Seattle, WA), Gina Sample (San Diego, CA) and Bob Boulware (Seattle, WA). It was really great to see Gina freestyle again - she''s in as good of shape as ever. This team played well but had a bit of trouble with the wind and would have to try to do well in the B Final to make the semis. \r\n\r\n B - Final - Saturday \r\nAll the teams who finished 3rd or lower in the prelim got to get one more chance at making semis by competing in a B Final. Saturday the crowd was much bigger as vacationing Italians and Europeans decending onto the beach. Throughout the B Final there was an estimated 800 spectators. Cindy, Gina and Bob came back out with a vengeance and hit their routine in a big way to win the B Final handily. Anne and Dan had another solid round and edged out the rest of the teams to take the 6th and last spot left for the semis. \r\n\r\nDemos for Italian MTV - Saturday \r\nItalian MTV showed up and Clay organized a couple spontaneous demos: Clay played with Reto and Jan I think and Gina played with Cindy, Rohre and Anne. Larry, Paul and I played as well. The footage should be excellent - and the interviews with Clay, Larry and myself may also be aired as well. I heard that it will be shown throughout Europe some time in May. I did get a shameless plug in for frisbee.com - we''ll see if they leave it in. (that gives me a week or two to get something up in French, Spanish, Italian, etc. on the site!) \r\n\r\nBeach jam - Saturday \r\nThere were several local intermediate players not competing that we jammed with on the beach. This sport is really taking off right now in Europe (Italy especially). There were probably 12 Italian jammers I saw who could do sticky body rolls, scarecrow brushes, laerbs kicks, leg over foot brushes and gitis. All the conditions are in place for a freestyle Renaissance - Playing Conditions, Mentors, Tournaments, and instructional & competition Videos. \r\n\r\nDisco jam - Semis - Saturday night/ Sunday morning (11pm - 1am) \r\nSaturday night the tournament directors reserved an entire Disco for the entire tournament. All the ultimate teams came in and made a big circle of about 700 players around the dance floor. This was the only real time the ultimate players were able to see freestyle competition the whole weekend and they were totally pumped up for it! The top 4 teams would make the finals. Winning the pool and stoking the crowd was Larry, Sune and Paul - they hit their routine and hit their indy''s big time. Dan Yarnel, Jeff and myself took second - we hit our co-ops ok, and hit some big combos (especially Jeff) but missed a few catches. Third went to Clay, Reto and Jan also dropping a few, but the crowd went nuts for Reto. Taking the last spot in the four team final was Anne and Dan - once again playing smart and solid. Cindy, Gina and Bob & Morgan, Enrico and Lor took 5th and 6th respectively. \r\n\r\n Sunday - Finals \r\nOnce again beautiful weather, nice wind, big crowds and excellent vibes were all around us and this time it was finals day. Dan and Anne played first and had another solid performance. Clay, Reto and Jan went big and hit big combo after big combo bringing the crowd to their feet. Because they had almost no co-ops they would end up placing third, although they won difficulty and were close behind in execution. \r\nDan, Jeff and me were next and we were fired up to play to the Who''s "Amazing Journey". We hit just about all our co-ops and once again nailed some big indys and ended our routine on a very positive note. Probably the best crowd I''ve played in front of since the US Open years. The final team of Paganello Larry, Sune and Paul came out and played great. But it was at the end of the routine when Larry was pinned against the end of the platform and still went for the leg over foot brush to a save to a huge scarecrow that probably gave them the title. Once the final results were tabulated they won by .2 points. Congratulations to Larry, Paul and Sune! \r\n\r\nThanks, and see ya next year! \r\nIf you couldn''t tell already this was one of the epic events in the short history of our sport. I can''t say enough about the hospitality, the hard work and organization that went into this Paganello 2000 World Freestyle Challenge. \r\n\r\nWe all send out a great big "Baci da America" (Kiss from America) to the event staff players who made it all happen! Ciao! \r\n\r\n- Tom \r\n\r\nPS Look for follow up articles from Bob Boulware and Rohre Titcomb - hopefully they''ll add anything I''ve left out and make any needed corrections as well.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A roaring wind smacked the other teams hard. Hosfeld and Kenny smacked back harder and put on a terrific performance. Call it the Howling Wind Jam. \r\n\r\nIt was a short field. Buddy Adams and Scott Sailor had a two-disc routine worked out that could have been a contender, if only the environment had cooperated. Things had gone well-enough for them the day before, and even better during the mid-day practice when the playing area was calm, warm, and humid. But after the winds suddenly kicked up, as if on cue ten minutes before the finals, they gambled and chose to stick with their planned program. \r\n\r\nAs it turned out, it the tasty low z moves they had designed were fodder for the blustery weather. More than once their disc was pulled beyond the bounds of the jamming area. \r\n\r\nVic Ouzoonian and I (Craig Simon aka Rip Van Winkle) finished as we seeded third, but it was a placement severely schooled by the wind. More than one of my bread-and-butter behind the back sets terminated as way-out-of-reach-misfires. \r\n\r\nVic, with more of a beach game, courageously attempted a variety of edge-guided and one-handed turnovers, but didn''t get to show his stuff. But I think we both felt better about Sunday''s struggle than Saturday''s run, even if we had both hit more in the prelims. It was fun for me at least, to actually play that intensely for a few short minutes, to hear a few cheers when I nailed a scarecrow and few other old-timer seals, and then to walk off the field with my leg muscles reminding me what a great workout freestyle is. \r\n\r\nAnd, as we all know, freestyle provides a great workout for the brain, too. If there''s any doubt, watch Paul Kenny put a disc through its paces, turning it any direction at will. Seeing what he''s developed over the four years since I last saw him is why I feel like Rip Van Winkle. Paul defines the future that I''m now living in. \r\n\r\nThis weekend also gave me my first chance to see elegant and energetic Scott Sailor up close, and to hear firsthand from him what it was like to put on a professionally choreographed on stage in a New York City theatre with Ted Oberhaus. It was also a chance for me to see Buddy get massive with power spins, peeling off muscular triples into perfectly timed flying gitises. Now a mature nineteen year-old, perrenial Junior champ Renee Pardo was there too. She put on a polished routine with Paul, the lone entry in a nominal mixed pairs category, held on the sun-drenched prelim Saturday. \r\n\r\nI started out by saying Greg did it all. There he was Friday night handling registrations, and then putting on a mini-clinic. And there he must have been. Saturday morning running and playing golf while the party of jammers snoozed and had a big slow breakfast. And there he was at dinner Saturday night doing non-stop over-the-head improvisational comedy, bewildering the waitress, while simultaneously demonstrating the fine art of launching forks and spoons off the table, flipping them through the air, plopping them into a pre-designated cup and not my watchful eye. \r\n\r\nAnd there also was Greg in the final round of golf (placing high in the final rankings I presume). And of course, there he was in the final round of freestyle, with just a few minutes warmup, triumphing in one of the best executed wind jams I''ll probably ever see. But he actually didn''t do it all. He missed the parking lot jam. \r\n\r\nThe crowd departed; the wind calmed; the day cooled, and after the awards ceremony out by the lake (punctuated by a water-skiing bevy of slender blonde females dressed in skimpy day-glo) Paul, Scott, Buddy, Vic and I found our way back to a nice open spot on some not-at-all-hot asphalt by the hotel. More leaping and spinning and mind-bending extension. There was slight attrition after that, but the die hards went on to enjoy a hot tub and a refreshing dip in the Best Western pool. \r\n\r\nInstead of experimenting and lounging, it''s a good guess that Greg was probably working, taking care of some last pieces of business. \r\n\r\nYo Greg!

In the third year of each of these events, these tournaments have taken off and become must-do events. Kraig Steffen has seen his "historical" event, somewhat of a throwback to the Frisbee/Hackey Sack festivals, explode. With the mayor of Bridgeport, a local on-site radio broadcast and numerous sponsor booths, this event has become an important event in the community and for jammers. There was a freestyle tournament, disc dog demos, pie tin throwing contests, pie eating contests (Frisbie brand only!) and a temporary disc golf course set up all set on a beautiful lawn on a lake. \r\n\r\nThe tournament was one of three events this day related to jammers and significant events in their lives. Carl Emerson had his wedding reception in eastern Connecticut (which about half of us attended after the tourney) and Roger Meier had a surprise 40th birthday party in NYC (which the other half attended). Tournament discs were signed by all the jammers and presented to both Roger and Carl. \r\n\r\nJudy Robbins (#1 female player in the world), Dan YarNail (current world champion) and myself all flew in. The New England and New York shredmeister contingents rounded out this amazingly deep field. There were two rounds with the first round essentially a demo round with a random order for the finals. The judges were fans in the audience and a couple of NEFA folks. The first round highlights were many as everyone was relaxed and getting loose. \r\n\r\nOne moment that sticks out involved Rob Fried and Doug Fresh. On one set, the disc goes between them. They both go for it. Rob sets up for a tasty flaud when at the last moment Doug casually grabs it with a flaird. Judy''s jamming had folks scratching their heads as they realized that it doesn''t matter how long your hair is, if you can shred, you can shred. Her and Rick Williams, in the spirit of the prevailing historical theme, dusted the rust and invoked their crusty stuff from the many demos they did in the ''80s in New England. A dangerous situation occurred as Petri continued doing moves with too many spins, creating a giant sinkhole. Osis Caplin is back! He and Petri have played a number of events together and the chemistry is obviously getting stronger. \r\n\r\nBill Dubilier had a bad attitude all day and Ritchie Regensberg put the disc through angles and contortions which are illegal in many countries. Dan and Steve "Pops" Scannell had a complicated routine developed. How do I know? Steve had secret tape on his wrist with all the formations and coops written on them. They did a lot of multi-disc stuff with mutual exchanges. Dan''s attitude was as bad as Bill''s. The prevailing question of the day was What is older, Steve, Ritchie or fire? How these guys SHRED at that age is incredible. Toddy "Gameday" Brodeur and I had a very fun jam with Toddy in particular just going off. \r\n\r\nThe Finals again were random order. More structured routines were the order with the jamming remaining hot. Each of the six teams played great! Having a six team field is nothing new, but here all the teams were strong. The highlights of this round included Rick and Judy''s routine. Rob and Doug, as always, tore it up. A word that has great meaning and applies to them is "appropriate". Taster''s choice is not just coffee. Toddy and I spiced up the proceedings a bit with an Indiana Jones takeoff. \r\n\r\nSome highlights included: \r\n\r\n\r\n- Petri''s triple spinning catches, many of themâ€¦also a kicking sequence to a bad attitude\r\n- Alan''s flamingosis and crows\r\n- Rob''s osis pulls, gitis shoot to osis and general ridicularity\r\n- Judy''s double spinning btb pull to crow\r\n- Doug''s fresh big air flaud, butt to the camera\r\n- Rick''s tipping sequence to a btb catch on the note\r\n- Dan''s flaud pull and roll sequence to a big kick (the picture on photopoint caught the kick)\r\n- Steve juggling (maturity with freestyle)\r\n- Ritchie''s tooth delay and odd angle weirdness\r\n- Bill''s spinning neck flaud, bad attitudes, gitis pull and cool ground work\r\n- Toddy''s triple pull to spinning flamingo, gitis pull, ollie and triple to btb catch the only one keeping Petri from embarrassing the field\r\n- My restricted pull to double spinning scarecrow on the note\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Kraig for a great event.

The 2000 Summerfest Open was definitively complete. From the huge numbers of great jammers to the perfect venue to the perfect hosting to the large number of fans, this tournament was a thorough and complete success story. At this moment, I personally would put this event and Paganello on a singular high pedestal. An overnight success after 20 years of putting his heart and soul into it, Steve Jennings has created a juggernaut. Set on an outdoor asphalt court surrounded by FULL stands at the worlds largest music festival (I believe) fired everyone up. The comaraderie inspired by the whole weekend''s setup made for as enjoyable an experience as is out there. Rodney and Bethany elevated the JuJu by providing accommodations for many, a massive lasagna dinner and breakfast (with great coffee!!) for all. Further, they did ALL the dirty work associated with a tournament. From setting up the judging so the jammers weren''t needed for the judging chores (seeding, getting qualified judges, doing the number crunching, having data printed etc), the underappreciated hard work did not go unnoticed. \r\n\r\nThe weekend began with a pre-mobup at a park on Lake Michigan. Typical reunion hugging turned into a massive jam with a continuous 4 group strong shredfest. The highlight was clearly the jam with Beast, Rando, Steve J. and Dave Lewis. They went off for quite a while, pulling the rest of us into fans, creating an ooh and ahh rhythm. Steve particularly impressed with his mega-spinning and extreme wind game capabilities. DaNail and Cindy had one of those rare zones where both hit a couple big indies and morphed (no, not Murfed though he would have been proud get well Dave!!) into an awesome speed flow that was just outstanding. \r\n\r\nDue to the fact I was warming up during some of the routines and might have missed essential components (I hope someone else might better review routine specifics), what follows are just some observations. The semifinals were held on the Summerfest grounds near the south gate, creating a walkby crowd even though we were not in a show situation so to speak. A most exciting part of the whole event was the extremely strong field for mixed. It was an equal to the open division. I think there were 7 mixed and 8 open teams extremely outstanding. Specific highlights included Poodle''s near catchless round. He made note of it about 2/3 of the way through the routine then hits a spinning planted gitis. Another highlight was Dave Lewis''s manic gitis "saves". It is my understanding that scientists have just unlocked the human genome map. Soon we may figure out exactly what it is Pat Marron is doing. Lisa and Arthur probably had the routine of the day tight, excellent stuff. \r\n\r\nThe finals saw us surrounded by hundreds of fans. In between routines, Steve worked the crowd in excellent fashion, having the folks participate in contests, explaining some of the technical stuff and maintaining interest while Rodney and Bethany were doing the dirty work This sophisticated presentation worked perfectly no one left and more and more people crowded around. The conditions were perfect for the Open round with a dry court and calm pre-storm winds. All teams played great. There were no losers here. First up, Laerbs and Joel got things off to a strong start, capturing the fans interest immediately. The highlight of the open round was Randy''s and DaNail''s routine. The Maestros fiddled with the crowd, lathering them into a frenzy. The legendary moment had to be Randy''s spinning splitosis. The routine was so good, it is believed this is the first time Randy threw his disc into the crowd after it was over. Jeff Kruger and I had a fun jam, playing off some beloved cultural icons. Arthur and Dave had an excellent shred with a lot of speedflow components. Arthur went off on a spinning scarecrow tangent while Dave tried to outspin him employing his own sealing compounds. \r\n\r\nThe mixed finals started after a rain delay, which left the court a bit wet.. Joel and Anne came out of the box with no pressure, playing relaxed. All of a sudden, Anne hits a big move, the crowd roars, she puts her arms up and cheers back at the crowd, then they crush. Great spon jam. Laerbs and Judy worked the fans with their veteran savvy. Jeff and Cindy came out with their typically strong routine, though had some footing problems. Despite that, Cindy hit a HUGE gitosis. Arthur and Lisa came out and were able to keep their routine together despite the footing. \r\n\r\nAfter the tourney, we all went back to the jam park for the first of two post-tourney mob-up. Well, no boom box needed there. A drummer with a big karaoke machine was playing. We all jammed to his "live" music for a while. The jam went about another hour before the rains came in full. This was about 6:30. Not having our fill, we all went back to the dorms at U. of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (where our hosts had found us good, cheap housing, creating a college-like atmosphere for those of us staying there) and found an aerobics room and continued to jam for a couple more hours. \r\n\r\nSteve, Rodney and Bethany ROCK \r\n\r\nthanks from all of us. \r\n\r\nPaul Kenny', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We started the event @ 2:00pm with anticipation of the low tide. The wind was strong and consistent, yet manageable. The tide was low at 2:30pm. \r\n\r\nWith only 6 teams we started the one round with the "NEW" World Beach Invitational Judges accelerating the risk of difficulty. \r\n\r\nOf Course if you did drop "A LOT" this would in turn effect flow and you were awarded accordingly. Now, what was fun was having the option after 5 mins the team could take advantage of the "TURBO MINUTE". This was a risk to obtain some Bonus points!!! If you spounch the opportunity you were to stop the routine and pour sand on your partners head, although you were not deducted any points! All in all EVERYBODY SHREDDED!!!! Bonus points were rewarded and no teams were sand bagged! \r\n\r\nThe Open Pairs was one round in random playing order thus putting all the teams in a limbo to see you jams first ect.. The first team out of the box...Joey Hudoklin and Dave Shiller. 2 min. before they were to jam Joey withdraws from the event with a pulled muscle injury! \r\n\r\nNow with only one minute remaining Mark Regalbuti steps in and plays with the Schillman. Their routine was sweet. Mark brushing in the wind and jamming to the music and passing to the Schillman. \r\n\r\nDave completely going off the scale and shredding to an awesome jam. \r\n\r\nThen came Chipper Bro and Danni Camernisi. The Flow was on! Jamming to Santana Danni starts with spinning brush combo to a hein 1-1/2 gitis. Tossing a clock to Chip starts with more brushing combo''s including a double leg over brush to over the leg roll to gitis! Super flow and using the environment proved to be a strong finish. \r\n\r\nThen Diego Gamboa and Anne Graves came out and showed a beautiful flow and co-op routine that was tough but manageable in the wind. They both played great. \r\n\r\nThen comes along Tommy Leitner and Dave Lewis emerge like two musketeers with sword controlling the wind Gods. Tommy Bad attitude delay off the throw, tipping, brushing, ad huge gitis. Passing to "Dazzling" Dave, at one point doing a tipping combo that even Master Joe was standing waving his arms "I am not worthy". Tommy Gets the disc and does a triple spinning flamingo skid pass right to Lewis''s pull to a triple into gitis...WOW... Dave and Tommy will be leaving a mark on the canvas that will be remembered for years to come! \r\n\r\nWe gave out the Hein Beach Gitis award... This was for the jammer that shredded in deep sand, Water,wind, and flow,(Minimal Drops) and great attitude! The Award went to TOMMY LEITNER. The award was presented by Joey Hudoklin! \r\n\r\nWe are doing this event again and again. hope we get some Jr''s and more midwest and east coast jammers in the future. \r\n\r\nKelly and I would like to thank, Patagonia, Innova-Champion, Discovering the world US Rentals and all the staff from WBI and the California Beach Party. And a special thanks to Tommy Leitner and Dave Lewis for helping run the whole thing! \r\n\r\nZZZZZZZ You next year! \r\n\r\nChipper Bro! \r\n\r\nThanks Chipper for another great event, next year the WBI will be sponsored by the Global Jammers Association (a newly formed for-profit association formed to raise money for alternative freestyle events) and may very well be one of the biggest events of 2001. \r\n\r\nMy vote for the hein jammer award goes to Chip Bell who peeled several incredible brushing combos in the soft sand right infront of the judges, including an under the leg body roll into a gitis! \r\n\r\nThe random co-op was a total blast - getting Richi Smitz, Dave Zeff, Scott Starr, Jay "newly wed" Hinkle, and Mark Regalbuti out there among many others. Schiller absolutely peeled in the random jam - taking out some frustration at losing a chance to play with Joey for the first time. \r\n\r\nThanks to Patagonia and the Surfrider Foundation for taking part in this event - save our oceans. \r\n\r\n- Tommy L', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In any case, the results were right out of survivor as exemplified by Toddy and Dan coming out, eating worms and bringing a snake charmer out with them. Because of the winds (25 or so), the results were skewed. Even though the results may not show it, some of the best shredding occurred from teams not making the cut. Specifically, Cindy and Terry Johnson (TJ) absolutely shredded. TJ loves wind and Cindy played as savvy as any. Carl Emerson and Jeff O''Brien hit some of the best moves of the day. Jeff has stuff I can only visualize on video! Buddy Adams and Scott Sailor had wicked strong moves but were bitten by the wind gods. Buddy hit his ordinary double spinning gitis from the old days (very old). In mixed, the wind gods again spoke loudly. Renee clearly had the move of the tournament, setting the disc way out, camping back putting on a monster pose and NAILING it big time. The Krugers peeled, especially Cindy, but were bitten again by the wind gods. \r\n\r\nIn any case, two teams from each open field made the finals which now will be indoors after the demo at the Jaguars game.\r\n\r\nMore tomorrow...Paul Kenny \r\n\r\nDue to the conditions experienced in Saturday''s outdoor rounds, two very important decisions were collectively made. First, a tribal destressification occurred at Cyclone Anaya''s where medically pure tequila was offered to the gods of shred. Secondly, the Sunday round would be played in a gym. \r\n\r\nThe group had excellent conditions for the Jacksonville Jaguars pregame demo, with light winds, a light drizzle and golf course green quality lawn with great drainage. The Jaguars decided late in the process to allow 10 performers do the pregame demo. All finalists were able to play. Dan Yarnell played with Toddy Brodeur, Tom Leitner played with Dave Lewis, Carlos "Pipo" Lopez played with Gregg Hosfeld, Jeff Kruger played with Paul Kenny, and Cindy Kruger played with Renee Pardo. All wore tournament embroidered golf shirts with an added embroidered commemorative patch on the sleeve. From what folks say, all were hitting hein combos. \r\n\r\nHurricane Gordon was pummeling the Gulf Coast driving Pipo, Dave and Tom to catch outbound flights as soon as possible, leaving only 50 minutes to complete Open finals. So, after the Jaguars show, we rushed back to the gym where finals began with Toddy and Dan. Coming off demo euphoria and having to play immediately saw both a bit off their games. They went for HUGE moves and combos but had trouble with the clampers. Up next, the masters Tom and Dave started conservatively, caught a couple and then caught fire...especially Dave, who put on a display for the ages. He went dropless and hit huge combos throughout, including a wicked strong close set double gitis. Tom does as only Tom does, flowing, insisting on consecutivity and carrying over a unique chemistry with Dave from Seattle and Ventura. Theirs was clearly the routine of the tournament. Pipo and Gregg came next. Pipo''s game carried over from the big winds and again he played strongly. He was by far the most consistent jammer, playing both extremes of conditions with equal flair and consistency. Gregg was clearly in his element, hitting the electric Ugglos...er...Uggos...for which he prides himself. Up last were Jeff K. and Paul K. We struggled a bit but had fun going for the Peanuts theme by half sponning and half doing the routine we did in Milwaukee and Seattle. \r\n\r\nAfter the awards ceremony (with FPA sponsored trophies and Olympics-styled gold, silver and bronze medals in honor of the ongoing competition in Australia), Pipo and Dave Lewis raced to the airport while Tom hung out about an hour more. Since it is 45 minutes to the airport, Tom did not want to feel rushed. With 50 minutes until his flight, Tom finally headed out and, pulling an OJ (the Hertz commercial OJ, not the white Bronco OJ), got hit in his butt by the aircraft door closing. The rest of us stayed a couple hours more in the gym, getting the mob up they all came to get. The hero of the mob up Jeff O''Brien, hitting head-scratching moves followed by head-scratching moves. Dan Yarnell jammed nonstop the whole two hours doing the things only he can do. Gregg sent a spinning disc through the hoop with Scott pulling out the delay. Other jammers not competing but coming out for the kharmonic mix were Rik Downs and Ron King. Ron’s game is very strong, even coming off some serious back problems and a two-year hiatus. Rik also played great. Several other Florida freestylers also took in the action to become reacquainted with the sport and its "personalities". \r\n\r\nThe now traditional post-tourney and Paganelloesque Italian dinner was the theme for the evening...lasagna, other pasta, chicken parm and marsala and ample Bolla Merlot were the main consumables. The "dance" portion saw most out on the patio observing Cindy and others making up their own music to her moves...singing “Maniac” clearly fit. Jeff O''Brien''s steps were the most unique displays of body movements seen this side of electrocutions. Hot-tubs were next with peanut gallery heckling the whole time. The local peace officers essentially ensured a 15 way tie for winning the party. It was a huge laughathon. Extra Special Thanks to Lawrence Frederick, and Carl Emerson.

Saturday was a jam day amid intermittent rain showers. The wind stayed constitent all day however and some epic jamming was had by all. \r\n\r\nSunday was an absolutely clear and gorgeous a day with warm steady breezes. The tide was high for the warm up jams but by tourney time, it was perfect. Routines were 8 minutes long. The first team featured John Titcomb from Seattle, Tam Wolfe from the United Flyers of Sonoma and the ever improving Melissa Jean Trail. The all passed the disc well, hit some big moves and warmed up the crowd. Some of the highlights were Tam''s scarecrow catch, Melissa''s big bad attitude and a stunning gitis by John Titcomb for the last catch, right on cue. He immediately announced that he had to leave to catch a flight. What a way to bow out! Tam (alien) and Melissa (skeleton) jammed in costume. \r\n\r\nThe second team consisted of the UFOS Carl Dobson, Doug Korns and Mike Esterbrook. They featuted an elaborate passing game. Carl enhanced the jam with spinning catches. Doug went for some classic beach moves and looked as smooth as ever. Mike Esterbrook was playing great all weekend and continued his strong play here. \r\n\r\nNext up was Skippy Jammer, Tom Leitner, Joey Hudoklin and Mike Esterbrook once again. Mike was playing so well, that this team wanted him to stick around and get them going. And get going they did. The team pulled off some specatular moves, Skippy did 6 skids in a row (all different). Joey pulled off huge combination after huge combination. Tom caught what was perhaps his best "Roots" ever in competition. Mike continued to be the glue. The main aspect of play for this team was not individual moves but passing the disc. It was an intricate exchange that bordered on the edge and sometimes on the absurd leaving members giggling after some notable exchanges. Joey''s wore a Lakers uniform with the number 8 and went had an assit to turnover ratio of infinity - a dozen assits and no turnovers. \r\n\r\nLast up was Mark "Buti" Regalbutti, Richie Smits and Paul Klimek. This team came out smoking too. Buti was fired up and in a shred or die mode from the get go. Paul Klimek played consistent pulling off some huge turnovers in strong wind. Richie looked like he had been transported back in time like some kind of time capsule. His play was superb all weekend and he hit nothing but big moves in the final - including a fully submerged water move with his shoes on. He is, in all likely hood, the most underrated players ever. In a beach environment with a steady breeze, he is one of the greatest ever for that style of play. \r\n\r\nA side note: This tourney marked the end of an era. Joey Hudoklin is moving back to New York City after living in California since 1978. It was at sometimes very emotional as he is loved by one and all and will be sorely missed. The one blessing is he is going back to NYC where the jam scene is thriving as always.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We had two mobs going nearly always, with about six jammers in each rotating from one to the other. \r\n\r\nTwo players who really stood out all day were Skippy and Arthur Coddington. Different styles, yet both consummate jammers, busting out solid indies and making even the most difficult passes look easy. Skippy went off many times combining near impossible skid combos with clean solid spinning seals. He gets into a kind of against rhythm, then from some restricted position shoots out a perfect sets to a huge seal. Arthur was churning out huge multi-spinning combinations with his usual ease. But it was also cool to experience his excellent passing game during the mobs. \r\n\r\nIt was a treat to have distant jammers Bob and Mike come and share the shred. Mike was tearing up the sand with his athletic style and huge air catches. He landed on the sand after one particularly high flying gitis, which probably measured on the Richter scale in nearby Golden Gate Park. I haven’t felt one like that since the days when Matt Gauthier was shakin’ the Ocean Beach sand.

We had five teams, 15 onlookers and were covered by the local newspaper. The evening saw lots of food including grilled pork loins prepared by brother Tim Downs, grilled pizza by bother-in-law Mike Haliday on his amazing portable ''kitchen stadium'' and I added a shrimp boil to the mix and it was all washed down with two types of kegged beer. The breakfasts were amazing as well. Some of us cross-trained on the awesome death defying rope swing set up in the woods.\r\n\r\n \r\nWe started the event by having local ''newbies'', Jim Nichols and Laura Renwick do a demo routine for experience''s sake. By virtue of a random draw Steve Scannell and Rik Downs led off. The first third of their  routine started  with low execution and difficulty but the second 2/3 saw them get into some sort of groove when their difficulty, execution and presentation were kicked up a few notches. The second team (The Ben and Jerry''s Beach Jammer Team aka The BJBJ Team) of David Kessler and Robbie Collier followed. Robbie is a beach jammer from Alabama and it showed but he had his hands full dealing with the swirling winds that ruled the day. David, who can be way turbo when he''s hot, had plenty of diff but also a few too many drops. The third group was composed of  H.B. Clark and Barry Gill. H.B. recently won 8th place in the world grand master disc golf tournament and Barry had TWO new hips placed back in the fall. These guys are old-school freestylers and are always entertaining to watch. Ron King and Alex Grammer made up the 4th pair.. Ron is a master of subtle disc manipulation but is still recovering from difficult back surgery. It is amazing to see what he can do with a disc. Alex will be a great new player for this area once he gathers experience. The 5th pair had the father and son team of Steve and Ryan Vinoski (Old Sox and New Sox). I''ve never seen Steve play better and Ryan, while he had youth and difficulty on his side, was frustrated with far too few completions. Everyone had a great time and since the majority of us have been competing at the Tennessee State Overall Tournament for decades it felt like a reunion. \r\nMany thanks to: Lisa Freeman of the Corps of Engineers for letting us use their playing                           field. Bill McDonough for the fantastic tournament design and video. Brian Bohannon for his opinions  and photography. Mike Haliday for great, inventive food and photography/video. Tim Downs for his grillin'' skills. Steve Scannell for his advice, experience and invaluable friendship.  Aimee Downs for her undying support and hugs.

They had all registered for the two categories of ‘Open Pairs’ and ‘Intermediate. That is 10 more than the previous year. There could have been even more if the 3 from Stuttgart and the 2 from Jena had also registered. They instead chose to only observe and pick up some new tricks.\r\n\r\nAs it was last year, the weather this year was again perfectly ideal. Another bonus was that despite a residential complaint, the officials from the state of Bavaria didn’t cut off our power supply that we needed to play or music. Although two of our participants, Toaster and Matthias did pull a few muscles.\r\n\r\nOnce again, like last year, the entire German Freestyle Disc family had a great time but the main difference this year is that everyone is much closer and knows each other much better. Almost traditionally, our event host, “Café Kabine” supplied us with a delicious buffet while Boris had generously offered the Weinerei to the competition during the Night Gitis Contest as an ideal transition from the day. Additionally new this year was our great new sponsorship that financed our food, beer and competition prizes.\r\n\r\nFriday, 2nd of September: Upon arrival at the Weinerei towards 10nish, the DVD of the German indoor competition in Berlin 2005 was being played.  Because many of us were starving by the end of the show, we headed off to the next ‘kitchen’, opposite the Weinerei, a Franconian beer garden, to rob our next Schnitzel. After that, there was no holding back, people were ready to play. Over at the Pegnitz passage, whilst downing 3 crates of Zirndofer, Fabio was fooling around and tossed my FPA-Disc membership into the river. Resulting in the both of us going for a dip in order to save my card. With such great atmosphere, we’re pretty sure that no one got to bed before 5am!\r\n\r\nSaturday, 3rd of September: After a monstrous breakfast and then gearing up with all the right gear, the games began! Unfortunately, the tournament started off with a slight set-back. Due to the city of Nuremberg’s refusal to register JAM’N’GO as an official event, we were not allowed to use a microphone to conduct the event. That resulted in us having to physically looking for people and crying out for CDs between 2-4pm. The qualification round for the ‘Open Pairs didn’t happen until around 4pm.  Although it was clear that the first team were all set and ready to go, the ghetto blaster was not accepting our CDs. Boris arranged another player that made enough noise that the neighbours had to notice.\r\n\r\nAround about 6ish, because Crumpler had agreed to sponsor prize for the winners, in exchange for the generosity, we were told that “the more noise you make about Crumpler, the happier we are &#61514;“. There was also a brief performance with the Frisbee-like ‘Crumpler sign’ just before the Night Gitis Contest took place. So there will be footage available soon on the event’s website.  \r\nSeptember is known to have shorter days, so it wasn’t surprising that we had headed for the nearby Pizzeria Trattoria by 8:30pm. But of course the worst comment had to come from Eleonora “that was the worse pizza I’ve ever had!”.  I couldn’t compare because I had ordered a salad &#61514;!\r\n\r\nNight Gitis Contest: The crate of beer from our sponsorship was consumed from the very first day. Therefore extra Zirndorf had t be organised. The rest was partly financed by the players themselves and the rest by some participants. The contest organised by Fabio and those in comparison to 2004 involved the introduction of new rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first runner up could have been Flo from Karlsruhe, who could pull Flamingo all the way to endless time what gained extra points. Second place could have belonged to Jan from Berlin. \r\nBesides the winners Anton and Markus from Berlin have to be considered also as winners, who both managed to achieved the Hammer Gitis! By about 2, it was pretty much knock off for everyone. What a jam packed day it was for everyone.\r\n\r\nSunday, 4th of September: Sunday started off way less chaotic as Saturday did. We weren’t exactly on schedule but we did manage to finish up with the finals at sunset at 8pm. I can’t write too much about the routines, had to calculate the results and motivate Adrian to pick up new supplies of beer. But the feedback itself was very positive. There were plenty of on-lookers, although they mostly bystanders or some who just turned up by coincidence for a sun bath. The ‘audience’ were obviously impressed by the acrobatic performance.\r\nFormer and current 1st place winners were Fabio and Eleonora, 2nd place runner-ups were Flo and Chris from Karlsruhe while 3rd place belonged to Kolja and Markus from Berlin. Jan and Anton from thankfully settled with “just” 4th place. I should mention that the results for 2nd - 4th were very close (1.14 points decided the victory).\r\n\r\nAn African drummer appeared out of the nowhere and offered drum roles during the prize ceremony. Then we headed over to O’steria, Nuremberg’s best pizzeria, one place I thought would change Eleonoras impression of German pizzas. It was over the pizza that we discussed the FPA Worlds for 2006, which will take place in Berlin so we’re hoping to have the opportunity to organise a Freestyle Disc tournament a week before that in Rimini, Italy. The idea is to organise a shuttle from Germany to Rimini and back and to promote the event along the way.  We’ll still have to see when and how, but it’ll all be announced on jamago.com.\r\n\r\nThank you to all of you that had came along, helped out, financed, or supported us with materials. The next Jam´n´Go 2006 will commence on Saturday the 29th of April through to Monday the 1st of May. The categories planned are Intermediate, Open pairs and COOP.

I winced and agreed to share a little of what made this such a special weekend for me and my family. OK, maybe too much.\r\nI started playing frisbee 26 years ago and the most memorable tournament I have ever been to is: This year''s Jammers.\r\nTwo things. First, my 14-year-old son, Josh, flew down from Connecticut and I watched him with pride; he was so excited to meet the world''s top players, and silently watching him treat each Jammer with respect, with reverance and with an enthusiasm to learn was something very special to me. Secondly, silently watching the Jammers here, welcoming Josh with respect, teaching him with patience and with enthusiasm was something very special to me. This weekend filled me with a pretty amazing feeling - loving my son like I do and loving this sport like I do - this weekend made me proud to be both a Father and a humble Jammer amongst all of you. You guys are great. Thanks you guys. Seriously, Thanks.\r\nFor those that have not been able to be here for The Jammers, Paul and Cheryl Kenny make you feel so welcome, and so glad to be here. They handle the small details and it is taken care of with love and with a caring and a passion that I have not seen with such purity. This is a tournament that somehow survives being ruled by uncontrollable elements such as the tides, the winds, and the weather. Paul not only makes you feel like being a Jammer is something special, he does it with a kind of in-your-face-scruffy-cheek-to-cheek-big-wet-kiss-hug-special-kind-of way.\r\nRandom Magic Moments in no particular order...\r\nZZZZ''s from Murf. Channel 4 News Beachcam Jam and interview with Paul and Murf. (I don''t think I''ve ever nailed up at 6:15 am before!) After all the anticipation, finally picking up Josh at The Sprinkler. Lori, Sara and Jeff O all saying at different times that they had a great jam together and being able to tell how they really really meant it. Traditional Almond Flavored Tequila. Welcome Jeff. David choosing to climb out of his crib for the very first time and multiple times after that. My patient Michele who let her husband play frisbee all day on the beach for 6 days and spent her Anniversary husbandless chasing a 21-month-old around who just learned how to climb out of his crib. I love you Bum Bum. Beach jamming and wishing someday I''d be as good as Cindy. Jamming with Tito. Gary Auerbach''s well-timed call to share the Love. He also was hoping for some illicit pics of secretly applied tattoos he provided, but I knew of none to offer. (Maybe if we only still had the \r\nCeltic''s Room...) Squatters Rights. The Popeye Omelet. Convenient Chairs and Gatorade.\r\nJammer of the tournament, Pat Marron. Jammer of the day, Josh Emerson. Hearing Murf say he had the best jam in 5 years. Hearing Jeff O''Brien say he tried to "Gitosis Out" but settled on doing a "gitis brush gitis brush gitis, instead"...Oh wait - "Twice!"... Sushi. Mexican. Red Wine. Burgers. More Sushi. Jeff O''Brien bringing a Juicer all the way from Colorado for Margaritas. We like Jeff a lot. Watching Jeff Kruger shred. Dave Lewis and his encouraging, enthusiastic throws to Josh for like, 8 hours, until Josh finally nailed the seemingly uninvented Spinitis. Watching Pipo play the winds. Watching Irwin spin and seal it time and again. Seeing Hos show up Sunday night after a Golf Tournament because, well, just because. That says a lot. Jan wanting freestyle to become a "contact sport." Jeff O doing a gitosis with authority on his first tournament attempt at the move. Hare Krishnas. That is, Hare Krishnas during Rodney and Jake''s routine. Watching Anne get better and better. \r\nWatching Steve Scannell and thinking, "Wow, he too keeps getting better and better!" Watching a very entertaining routine from Rico and Jamie. Also watching very entertaining routines from Jamie without Rico! Watching Paul & Pat shred. Watching Jake doing this oh-so-quick-under-the-leg-brush and then realizing duh, that was to me... Josh bodysurfing. Once. Vic and the daiper bag. Thanks Vic. Hearing that Michele is talking religion at 1am with Jamie and Craig and me deciding to avoid Paul''s front yard until it was time to leave. Jeff saying we spent an hour not wanting the night to end and two hours convincing Michele it was time for the night to end. Josh spending more time with Murf and Dave Lewis than with his own father. Josh going airborn over my head and catching the disc. Sushi cell phone calls. Michele saying that she would never have thought Rodney and Bethany were married, because they act like they are still dating.\r\nPaul''s recognition of things that matter during The Feast and Awards. Irwin giving the FPA''s namesake Jam of the Year Award to Jake et all. The Dave Lewis Photo during Paul''s Feast and Awards. The repetitive Dave Lewis Reaction during Paul''s Feast and Awards. More traditional almond flavored Tequila. Michele''s Lasagna and sauce, my mom''s Keilbasa. Jeanine''s seafood casserole. Tito''s son Alex stoked for getting a medal. Seeing the endless contributions, the unselfish giving of time and effort from Jeanine, Bernie and Hubby, Ma Kenny (aka newly found Grandma Kenny to Josh and David), JT and Crew, Dan Berman, Lori, Bethany, and Anne. I know I missed so many others. \r\nDuring the weekend, so many things were said, were done, and were shared with Michele, Josh, David & me, that we felt so blessed. We would like to send big hugs to Paul and Cheryl. Jeanine. Murf. Jeff O''Brien. Dave Lewis. Sara Bergman. Gilbert. Tito and Alex. Ma Kenny. Lori. Pipo. Larry. Jan. Pat. Jamie. Craig. Dan. Just re-reading your names makes me smile. Thanks.\r\nAnd one last note - Josh just called tonight. Today was his first day back and he had to pitch in a key baseball game for his school. He threw a no-hitter.\r\nHe said it was nothing compared to this weekend.', 'y', 'thejammers.com', 'thejammer@comcast.net', 'US - East', 'n'),

With Sune having secured the overall title via his victory in DDC moments before freestyle began, the possiblity of the United States being shut out of the victory circle loomed. (No American women competed). \r\n\r\nIn front of a VERY receptive crowd of 500 at Kaivopuisto Park in Helsinki - Nilson, Alhstrom and Johson opened the finals showing their well rehearsed routine. This young team from Sweden will be one to watch. Karlsson, Karlsson and Arversk followed with a crowd stirring, high difficulty and adeptly choreographed routine. \r\n\r\nThe crowd got a real treat as Wahrmann, Zimmermann and Storz began to heat up. Hartmut uses his remarkable athleticism to do several hi diff moves. Reto went out of his mind during a couple combos sending the crowd into a frenzy. His double spinning gitis close to the audience made a National Television broadcast. \r\n\r\nI was unable to see the next 2 routines because I had to warm up. I gathered that Imperiale, Wright and Wentzel played very solid hitting many music cues and doing some very tight co-ops. They played to - something from Uma Guma I believe, by Pink Floyd into Santana. \r\n\r\nThe Finish home town favorites Isola and Ruuhinen were pared with Jan Ekman of Sweden. Everyone wanted to know if their Semi Final performance was a fluke. (They had upset Wright/Imperiale/Wentzel to win their pool). All I know is the crowd was making an incredible amount of noise when I was warming up. I think these guys played real hot. \r\n\r\nFinally, the top seded team of the tournament Schiller, Leitner and Richards performed. After an early drop and a fairly slow start something clicked and Schiller did some of the hottest combos of the tournament including a double spinnig flamingo pull to a double spinning (in the other direction) flamingo-osis catch. He also did a mondo against the spin combo off one of Leitner''s hi Z "spanker" throws. By the end of the routine it seemed clear the high difficulty of their routine combined with clean execution (2 drops) had earned them the title. For Richards it was his first world title. For Leitner and Schiller is was their 10th joining Larry Imperiale (10), Kevin Givens (11), and Joey Hudoklin (12) with 10 or more world titles. \r\n\r\nLater at the awards ceremony Leitner dedicated the routine to his Finnish friend Myka Nordman. at 20 years of age Myka had been one of the hottest players at his age in the history of the sport and has the distinction of being the first Finnish national break dancing champion. Joey Hudoklin recalled, "Myka had so many tools at an early age, he would have truly been one of the all time greats." A tragic fall has left Myka paralyzed and confined to a wheel chair. He attended the finals and was greeted warmly by the competitors many of whom had not seen him in close to 10 years.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The three had an excellent routine with a great display of kick brushing by the Beast, some sweet combos by Mike, and a couple of high jumping catches by Steve Scannell. Beast played solid and took home the gold! \r\n\r\n2nd in a close race went to Tom Gleason and Jeff Soto. These two displayed good control and performed a smooth routine. Their styles went very well together, and both were able to shred with some spinning catches. \r\n\r\n3rd went to John Kirkland and Dan Roddick. They had a quick catch routine with lots of variety. Kirkland pulled out the major crust with some catches under his shirt and and both had lots of great unusual throws, Stork did gitis! \r\n\r\n\r\nFreestyle Masters\r\n1st went to surprise winners Greg Riley and Mark Blakemore. They were able to perform their fully choreographed routine very well in finals, winning high presentation points, wowwing the crowd, and performing a flowing, well -executed routine, with good difficulty. Mark was able to pull off all those torqued moves he does so well with his long extensions, he even sealed an amazing Oliver! Greg also was in top form with turnovers and smooth rolling work. Both were very pleased and excited with their first championship trophy and everyone else was very happy for them. \r\n2nd went to Larry Imperiale, Randy Silvey, and Joel Rogers. They performed very well in semis, shredding their pool and taking top seed. In finals, they also had some excellent stuff, Larabs doing a couple of long brushing body-rolling moves, Randy ripping off a sweet tipping combo to a double spinning catch and some benign work, Joel adding his expertise with some turnover work, and the high gitis. But they were unable to seal their fate as the clampers wouldn''t shut on several of the big crucial crescendo catches. \r\n\r\n3rd was taken by Vancouver hometown favorite Glen Whitlock pairing with Peter Laubert. Both pulled off some very nice stuff, Glen brought out the heavy crust with some great original third-world stuff, some on the edge benign material, and even some paddidling, and he laid it out once which everyone loved. Peter did his awesome, smooth rolls and both were very pleased with their play. \r\n\r\n4th was taken by Harvey Brandt, Paul Brenner from NY, and Rick Williams who put on a good spontaneous show. Harvey is playing better than ever, tuning up for Helsinki. Rick Williams played well with his signature moves followed by nice, flowy catches, and Paul Brenner (making a run for the overall) coming out with some excellent counter stuff and spinning catches. \r\n\r\n5th went to Mark Relgalbuti and John O''Malley who played very well. Their routine was well choreographed with a good variety of smooth co- ops combined with accelerated individual moves by Johnny O and Buti. Buti hit one move that make everyone whoop--finishing a combo with a swoop turn to a leg roll-body roll. Smooth as silk. \r\n\r\n6th place went to overall contenders Andy Lemann, Cliff Towne and John Shiller: Cliffy psyched up the crowd with some love talk to lead off the finals. All three players had some very nice individual moves, Shiller pulled off two body rolls to a back roll, but lost the seal. Andy Lemann revealing with his fine freestyle play that, though he is known as an overall player, he delights in the art freestyling with the rest of us. \r\n\r\nLots of guest and competing jammers played until dark, including but not limited to: Jeff and Cindy Kruger , Gary Auerbach of Toronto, Mary Jorgenson, Lisa Hunrichs and Randy Silvey, Mark Regalbuti, Johnny O''Malley, Joel Rogers, Beast, Tom Gleason, Jeff Soto, Paul Brenner, Greg Riley and Mark Blakemore, Peter Laubert, Jack Augnestoff of Vancouver Island. Several new and experienced jammers are on the horizon in Vancouver, that''s always good to see! \r\n\r\n\r\nFreestyle Masters - Women''s Division\r\nJudy Robbins won with a beautiful technical one drop routine. This was her first Masters tournament. Second Place was Tam Wolfe Viger with a healing Mike Esterbrook throwing to her, and Third Place was JoAnn with Laerbs throwing her counter. \r\n\r\nThanks to Lisa Hunrichs & Tam Wolfe Viger for this report!', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A big highlight of this round was the back and forth big air mega-gitases of Toddy Brodeur and Jamie Chantiles. Jaime has just returned from a couple of knee injuries and left the rust in the dust.

We had all types of weather - sultry, chilly, rain, sun, wind - with a nice day for the freestyle competition on Sunday. Due to the weather on Saturday, and a tournament schedule change, the last couple of pairs on Sunday played in the darkening evening, which did nothing to quell the shred factor.\r\n\r\nBy Dan Y.:  My Va. States experience was really great. Flying to D.C. then taking a train to Fredericksburg then walking to the tournament site just in time to play D.D.C.  Meeting my frisbee hero Scott Zimmerman and making the A pool playing with Rick Sader. They say freestylers make good DDC players. Saturday was a rain day with the hard-core over-allers golfing and wondering why. Got to watch a long New York jam in the rain thinking these conditions are probably normal for them.\r\n   Saturday night many of us got to witness an epic jam starring Ted, Randy, Joey, Doug E. , and Pat Rabdau. It was the most incredible jam I have ever seen. You should have seen the looks on their faces after some of the catches were made.   Freestyle Sunday featured a live band which accompanied many of the teams'' routines. Even the guitarist was a jammer. 17 entrants most of which were 3-way teams. I saw Petri catching nonstop doubles and triples, Rob Fried playing flawlessly, and Pat Marron shredding for his team on two bad ankles.\r\n   Later that night the priveledged few got to hear a Rob and Joey guitar jam featuring Lou singing an improvised song called "Brokeback Mountain Cowboy". This Texan loves hanging out with the New Yorkers.\r\n   By the way, all this cost $65.00 for entry fee to all the events, all the food, beer, coffee, water,etc. for 3 days and a nice long-sleeved T-shirt. I got to see so many old friends and got re-aquainted with people I haven''t seen in years. I thank Lazlo, Jamco, and everyone who was there.', 'y', '', 'ericolsen@co.stafford.va.us', 'US - East', 'n'),

It''s unbelievable that a week has flown by since many top ranked freestylers flew into and out of town, and left their shorching routines on the dry grasses of Scottsdale AZ. The weather couldn''t have been more perfect for the sixteen team prelim to get on it''s way. I believe this is the largest freestyle field in many years (at least since I''ve been participating and ran the event). Due to the large number of registered freestylers and a slow start-up, the finals went into the early evening under ballfield lights. Several freestylers actually had to run off the field after playing to grab a flight back to home. \r\n\r\nAwards going to the most traveled for participating in just one event include: Paul Kenney (Jacksonville FL) competitor and Jamie Chantilles (New York, NY) non-competitor. Needless to say there were many folks that joined us from Colorado, Northern and Southern CA, Chicago IL, North Carolina and elsewhere that made the trip to participate in this premiere overall event as well! \r\n\r\nAs the beautiful AZ sunset closed the day, the finals were set for the top 4 teams in each pool to play into the evening. Routines to note were the technically challenging yet flowing routine by Gina Sample and Dave Lewis as well as the routine of Joel Rogers and Bill Wright which was less choreographed but teeming with energy and movement. Rarely is there a tie in FPA events, yet these two teams showed that technical merit and flow/grace have balance in judging these events. Murphy/ Coddington gave Schiller/Richard a run for the coveted hand-crafted wooden freestyle trophies. Chuck and Dave S. played well. Their powerful and exciting endings generated lots of crowd pleasing minutes. They also executed their routine well by only dropping 1 time. But Arthur and Dave M. were too strong in presentation and difficulty to edge out the competiton. Murphy has really come back strong after severe back surgery only one year ago. It''s unbelievable that he attempts the same moves that he had in the past and still can pull them off as if there were no indication of any back problems! The finals were strong for the most part and all routines are available on videotape for a nominal $10 (plus shippng & handling charges). For more info. please forward your address and phone # and check to me so that I might do begin on the mass reproduction of videotapes (approximate mailing dates in Jan.). \r\nCongratulations to all the winners and participants. \r\n\r\nShred on and keep ''em spinning!\r\n\r\nJudy Robbins', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Here''s some history from Larry Imperiale as to how this event started:\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1997, I was in the Czech Republic jamming and playing ultimate. The Prague team invited me come with them that week-end to a Beach Ultimate Tournament in Rostock, in the north of Germany on the Baltic sea. It was a mini-Paganello with about 400 players, even though I didn''t know what a Paganello was yet. At the end of a day of ultimate, they asked me to do a freestyle show. In my life of jamming I''ve never had a crowd reaction as enthusiastic as that. They loved it, and after a 3 minute dropless demo, I ended it so they didn''t get burned out on freestyle and maybe wanted to seem more in the future. At the end of a most awesome event, they said, "Larry, if you had fun here you must go to Paganello next year!" So I emailed Jumpi about doing a freestyle event there, and found out Clay and Reto had been doing demnos there from time to time, but there had never been a tournament. So it was on for the next year!\r\n\r\nIn April 1998 we had the first "Acrobatic Paganello" as they called it then. The rest is history as they say.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The weather was perfect all week long. The results were a complete blowout win with a dropless routine by Dave Lewis and Pipo Lopez. They look primed to compete at the FPA''s in Berlin hitting clean co-ops and playing conficently through the whole routine. Second place featured a stunning comback for recently ailing Jonathan Willet who with team mate Jamie Chantilles took full advantage of the sweet winds off of Monerey Bay. Third went to the flowmasters Chipper Bro Bell and Divin'' Dave Bailey. Bailey suffered a seperated shoulder on his signature tuck and roll gitis early in the routine but continued undaunted. Fourth went to crustmasters Dan "Stork" Roddick, Jim Herrick and Rick Williams. 5th went to Skippy Jammer, Mark Regalbutti and Carl Dobson. Steve Scannel and Doug Korns rounded out the field.', 'y', 'web.mac.com/tmbanzai/iWeb/Masters_Juniors%202006/Welcome.html', 'kdgivens@ucsc.edu', 'US - West', 'n'),

The area is a bit above the beach. There is a ton of “tradition” that goes along with this space. There are memories of many a great jammers who have played and competed here from as for back as 1981. That is part of why we gather at this spot. Also it is close to the DePaola’s house a.k.a. The Barber Homestead.\r\n   \r\nWe had sweet weather all weekend. Everyone that was there had a fantastic time and were very well taken care of. The wind was from the north and fairly steady. The atmosphere was casual and fun. We had all levels of players. We had the crumbs of the crust, who brushed off the dust. We had the dong, the young and the young at heart. The “X”  “Y” and “Z” generations all  together. The Post Office Green saw Freestyle Frisbee once again. Chris and Lindsey, our hosts,  made sure we all got plenty of food and water and everything else we needed to play all day. At one point, a wedding party was at the gazebo to take photos of the bride and groom, I put a spin jammer on each of their fingers for their best photo. Gannsett Style\r\n  The gitis mallet was a going “Wigoa wigoa” and the “Big \r\nCatch Quacker” was  Quack-QUACK QUACKKIN!!\r\nTom  R and Rich H gave out Flying Aces Disc in memory of  the late Wayne Roberts.\r\nThere were many great jams that day. Last song of the day was announced and it was a 34 minute Grateful Dead Jam.  \r\nUnofficial Results:\r\n1. Joey H, Ted O, Rob F\r\n2. Doug E Fresh, Petri, Ryan Vinoski\r\n3. Steve Vinoski, Scannell, Alan C\r\n4. Tom R, Rick H, Toddy\r\n5. Lou, Anne, Donny Bee\r\n6. Caleb, Charlotte, Chris DePaola\r\n7. Andy Sibling, Tyler, Bryan\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of us set up tents and camped in the back yard.  It was a beautiful night. There was plenty of room for many  more. It’s a comfortable atmosphere at the “Barber Homestead” and we ate and drank to our hearts delight.\r\nWe played a game called Yankee swap. Everyone put some disc related item in a big bag and then we all picked one. You could trade your pick with any one else who picked before you. Rob put in a sweet 1981 Rose Bowl disc,  Samantha got an All Star Thursday gift pack complete with a Gitis Mallet, and Charlotte, Chris’7 year old daughter got a Buzbee. It was great fun. \r\nJoey and Rob a.k.a “Bluefish” played a long juicy set with Steve V. on harmonica. Toward the end of the set they had Lou come up and sing with them. The song was “Folsom Prison Blues” by Johnny Cash. Lou did a great job on vocals, then in the middle, they broke into a jam and Toddy joined in playing the “Big Catch Quacker”  It was A “once-in-a-lifetime“, you had to be there musical moment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we all had a wonderful breakfast and went swimming in the lake and enjoyed the warm sun.  By noon time most of us ended up heading to Newport Beach and jammed for many more hours. At last came the end of the weekend drinking one more beer and eating chowda at Flo‘s clam shack. Thanks to all who made it happen.\r\n\r\nDotty Ruedorb', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Players travelled from all over California to play - from San Diego, Palm Springs, Sacramento, San Jose, San Rafael, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, San Jose, Cupertino, Berkeley, Lafayette and San Francisco. All together 19 jammers were on the beach - sideline jammers included Robert "date man" Lower and Art Viger as well as local wind masters Roger, Dave and John. \r\nThe teams really took advantage of the low-tide and the nice wind with everybody pushing their level ability to the fullest. It was really great to see Hal Erickson, Scott Weaver and Keith Armstrong return to action. Look for another Ocean Beach event later this spring :) \r\n\r\nreport from Carl:\r\nThe first ever Ocean Beach Wintershred (San Francisco, California) turned out to be an awesome day of jamming in the California sun. The weather couldn''t have been more perfect. Temps in the 60''s, excellent sea breezes, minus tide and crystal clear skies all made for some of the best jamming conditions these eyes have ever seen. Fifteen competitors competed in open pairs and also a random draw co-op division. There were many other friends who came out just to jam and watch us compete, and then there was the huge crowd out on Frisco''s main beach who were unexpectedly treated to a great freestyle show. \r\n\r\nAfter a couple hours of mobbing, we started the pairs competition, random drawing the starting order. Kicking off the 1st Wintershred was the ultra turbo, super hein pair of Arthur Coddington and Dave Murphy. These guys blistered out of the blocks and rarely paused during their entire six minute routine. At one point, Arthur hit a nice triple spinning under leg to a triple chair catch. His against pulls and shoots were really working well and he sealed some clutch mega spinning crows and a textbook aerial gitus off of a Dave shoot. Dave used the perfect sea breeze to really peel out. He hit a bunch of quad spinning moves and one quint later during co-ops. One of my favorites was a really clean triple spinning flamingitis for maximum bonus points, that after a particularly sick combo of moves. His best though, might have been late in their routine when he started off down in the sand doing his legovers and rolls from off his back, then moving up he went into a quad of consequetive back rolls ending in a backroll set directly into a flamingitis. Near the end of their time I paused and panned my eyes across the sand for a second and noticed that everyone on the entire beach had stopped what they were doing and with jaws dropped, were watching in amazement what was taking place before them. Freestyle is an awesome spectator sport! \r\n\r\nAnother notable pair to play was the team of Tom Leitner and Hal Erickson. I haven''t seen Hal at any tournaments or jams recently, but it didn''t show in his play. He dusted the crust and hit some big moves, classic flat work and some big spinning seals. He and Lightning had a great passing game going with Hal terminating one run down by the water, with a monster crow. Tommy was in his element... on the beach, perfect day, solid breeze and he went off. On one brushing run Tom explored just about every option of brush imaginable. Starting off with a Double over didge, he shot out a set from a very bad attitude, spun, brushed again from bad attitude and then toured the beach on a consequetive brush/roll run for roughly thirty yards finally ending in a big crash and burn roots. \r\n\r\nOther highlights... \r\n\r\n\r\nJohny O'' Malley... Perhaps the biggest air gitis of the day. Sky City!\r\nKeith Armstrong... Nice spinning flamingitis pull with a c & b gitis seal. \r\n\r\nTom Sahlit... Great spinning chair catch off a roll combo. Cool flamingitis\r\n\r\nMelissa... Beautiful bad attitude catch off a roll set\r\n\r\nButi... Nice tipping sequence to a double leg over set to a spinning u leg catch\r\n\r\nScott Weaver... Incredible repitoire of rolls, spin changes and low spin moves\r\n\r\nDoug Korns... Some awesome new turnovers, ud crow seals\r\n\r\nTam Wolfe... Stuck a spinning scarecrow, also a nice twisto shoot\r\n\r\nMike Esterbrook... Crow brush, double barrel catch and big vacation attempt\r\n\r\nMike Cloud... spinning triple fake pull, solid gitis seals\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for that crazy random drawing for co-ops... I''ll copy you from e-mail I sent to Laerb''s explaining how we came to draw such an awesome team. \r\nI can tell you it was pure luck, because I was the one pulling the names out of the hat. It was pure chance. There were only six names left after drawing the first three teams and with pick 10 I selected Dave Murphy. I started thinking cool, because my name hadn''t come up yet and the odds of playing with someone great were getting pretty good. Next I pulled Arthur''s name and I''m starting to think this is getting a little weird and then to complete the team I pulled Tommy''s name out of the hat. What were the odds of that? \r\n\r\nThey played great, of course, coaxing eachother to push the envelope time and time again. I was calling out the time to the teams and when it came to the thirty second left call, they were shooting the disc back and forth and pulling off something really sick. So I looked around at everyone watching and asked if they didn''t mind if I let them play an extra minute or two. I got a bunch of thumbs up and we enjoyed an extended play version of a freestyle dream team. \r\n\r\n- Carl Dobson', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Many articles on the event appeared in local and national newspapers as well as television. Also, a film crew from Germany was there all weekend filming a documentary of Paganello 2002. \r\n\r\nThe Major of Rimini was in attendance for the freestyle and he threw out the honorary first throw of the Ultimate Final. \r\n\r\nThe players were blessed with perfect weather all week long as sunny skys and light winds prevailed. The freestyle semi-final at Alto Mondo Studio featured some stirring performances and the audience of 1,000 plus Utlimate players made enough noise to shake the building. The freestyle team from Milan dedicated their routine to their friend Morgan who passed away last year. \r\n\r\nCongratulations to the 2002 Paganello freestyle Champions, Team Texas and thanks to all the competitors for coming out to support this amazing happening! Once again Clay and Lui produced a world class frisbee event. \r\n\r\nGrazie Clay, Lui, Gigi and the rest of the Paganello staff!!!\r\nFrom Tommy\r\n------\r\n\r\nFollowing by John W. Titcomb, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe world’s best players came from around the world and from the best jam sites in Italy to compete in this year’s Acrobatic. Paganello. Eleven teams competed. The beach and the wind and the stage were perfect for the competition, including the wild ambiance for semifinals at the Altro Mondo discotheque Saturday night at midnight. The Texas team of Dan Yarnell, Tristan Doshier, and Steve Haynes, who in previous years have won at the Worlds in the co-op division were the winners in a close final on a beautiful Easter Sunday. Also this year, and as important as the competition itself, as in Ultimate, the players initiated the Spirit of the Jam award for Paganello, which was won by Clay Collera, one of Rimini’s own and a prime mover of freestyle in Italy and Europe.  \r\nTom Leitner and Team \r\n\r\nDan, Steve, and Tristan busted seed in the final to beat Paul Kenny and Reto Zimmerman, who finished 3rd, and Pipo Lopez, Patrick Marron, and Tom Leitner, who finished 2nd. The Texans’ multi-disc, high difficulty, and truly acrobatic co-op routine, with only minor drops, carried the day as the teams playing after them could not match their play. A notable fourth place was accomplished by the finely schemed Clay, Lorenzo, and Fernando routine, which unfortunately suffered from execution fatigue. (It’s hard to be one of the Tournament Directors and play tops, too!) \r\n\r\nOf the eleven teams competing 4 were made entirely of Italian players, and more than half of the teams were truly international. As with Ultimate, Paga freestyle attracts the best from the whole world.  \r\n \r\nPaul Kenny Multi-Disc Crow \r\n\r\nSpirit of the Jam Award: Clay Collera. \r\n\r\nThroughout Paganello’s time there were many other jammers besides those competing listed above. Thank you all, and Z you next year! \r\n------\r\nThe Paganello Experience\r\nby Steve Hanes \r\n\r\nThe doubt\r\nPaganello-the name is a cadence, a song of sun, sand and community. Before my visit this year, I was skeptical about Paganello. Dan Yarnell had visited the Rimini event in 2000 and described it as overwhelming. Larry Imperiale had raved about it for years. I wasn''t swayed. Dan and Tristan Doshier went in 2001. Tristan called me as soon as he returned to Fort Worth, gushing with details of the energy and roar of the spectators. I was steadfast-it just couldn''t be that good, could it? Dan and Tristan invited me, urged me to go this year. I worried about the cost and I fretted that Paganello 2002’s earlier date meant bad weather, but I was determined to see it and form my own opinion. \r\n\r\nThe place\r\nMy doubts were dispelled the very first day. Rimini is a small seaside community with winding streets, majestic hotels, tiny green parks, great restaurants and shops. We had three glorious days of warm, sunny days with cold, crisp nights. Each day the wind became gentler, kinder. The beauty of the weather was matched by the hospitality and kindness of the event staff and the people of Rimini. The festival site was a village of white tents set on light brown sand. Little children cavorted and dug sand castles. Dogs danced impatiently along the beach, imploring their masters to chase and play with them. Beautiful Italian couples strolled along the beach, dressed in fine black leather jackets and jeans. The young, sunburned faces of ultimate players mixed with the smiling stares of spectators. Huge multicolored kites rocked gently far above our heads. There were jugglers, dancers, unicyclists, skate boarders, rock bands, a bungee trampoline and hundreds of flying discs in the air. As Tristan had said, "If you love Frisbee, then this is it." It was as if Federico Fellini, the great Italian film director, had one of his movies spill to life on the very beach where he filmed life is a heavenly circus. \r\n\r\nThe event\r\nItalians Clay and Lui Collera directed the freestyle with professionalism and aplomb. Clay provided the jam intensity and Lui functioned as the female version of Rappin’ John. Every freestyler at Paganello 2002 owes Clay and Lui big props and a hardy ‘bene facto’. The teams from Rome and Milan were a joy to watch. The Milan team went crow happy in the finals. The Italian disc community is packed with players whose fervor matches the American freestyle scene, circa 1975. FPA director Paul Kenney insured that the event ran to specifications and added his distinctive disc work to the mix. Paul continues to be most creative player I’ve seen and I will steal every move I can from him. Reto Zimmerman ruled the nightclub portion of the competition with his unsurpassed athleticism. Pat Marron and ‘Peeps’ Lopez ruled the beach. Ann Graves, Tommy Leitner and Tristan Doshier reached down deep and played superbly during the finals. The entire Titcomb clan was there except for Rohre. I''ve said this many times, the Titcombs are the future of American freestyle. Gary Auerbach worked the crowd with an ease and grace that only he has. He gave more joy to the Rimini children than anyone there. Dan Yarnell inspired me with his knowledge of Rimini and his unbelievable play. And a special thanks to "Euro" for the great jam apparel and his kindness. Come and shred America, Euro-we''re waiting. \r\n\r\nIn summary, these words will never do justice to the Paganello experience, but as we Texans would say about something they love - "Paganello, It''ll git it."', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It was, ''as advertised'', a jam-packed weekend of shredding, where the playing conditions consisted of low tides, sweet ocean breezes and kickin'' tunes (powered by our new, portable sound system). Everybody fired up and the conditions helped bring out their best beach game. There was a nice blend of locals and jammers from abroad as players came from Baton Rough, Minneapolis, Portland, San Diego, Los Angeles and the San Francisco bay area. \r\n\r\nDid you see that? \r\n\r\n After an awesome open pairs round and a full day of jamming we gathered for a sunset drum circle on the beach and were treated to one of the most spectacular displays of dolphin and seal acrobatics I''ve ever seen (and I grew up on these beaches!). First, there were several groups of dolphin swimming back and forth in front of where we were drumming, coming closer each time, as if they were drawn to the drum beat. Then, just before dusk a dolphin jumped completely out of the water - not a curling dive like you usually see but a straight up, verticle leap extending it''s body to the max. Everybody happened to be watching so we all cheered. In response, the dolphin performed the leap 3 more times in sucession as we continued to cheer it on. Only a few minutes later we saw another rare sight - about a half dozen seals were jumping completely out of the water as if they wanted to get into the act as well. Add to that the otters which were hanging out only meters from the shore and the diving pelicans and you get the idea - our jam day had become a beach safari. :) \r\n\r\nThe entertainment didn''t stop there, after it started to get dark one of our friends, Jill, brought out her fire sticks and did an amazing fire dance backed up by the drums. Everybody on the beach came over to watch and a crowd of about 50 people gathered. What a great sight! \r\n\r\nOh yeah, there was also a freestyle frisbee event happening too... ;) \r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Pairs \r\n\r\n Tam Wolfe and Melissa Trail started things off with a bang, they jammed well with Tam hitting a flylng gitis and Melissa nailing the water catch. The 4th place team was Paul Klimek and Anne Graves, Paul hit his patented turnover brushing combo and Anne played confidently in the wind - it seemed like it was just another day at La Jolla Cove for her. \r\n\r\n3nd Place went to Pat Marron and Tommy Leitner (me). Our team was on the edge and we hit some ridiculous stuff but the catches bounced off our hands a few too many times. Taking 2nd place with an outstanding effort was Jamie Chantiles and Jake Gauthier. Jamie did some awesome roll-attitude change-invert roll combos and huge gitises while Jake played like the wind master he is - flowin from against move to scarecrow brush to phlaud. \r\n\r\nDeaton Mitchell and Skippy Jammer totally ripped it up for almost the entire 7 minutes of their winning routine. They hit all the bonus moves (flying gitis, scarecrow brush, backroll to teammate''s catch) and super bonus moves (water catch, triple spinning catch and bad attittude brush), Deaton hit some big spinning catches and showed a variety of airbrushes and Skippy nailed 5 against moves in a row and hit a scarecrow pull to a vacation. This was the routine of the weekend for sure! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMixed Pairs \r\n\r\n The mixed pairs round was smokin''! All the teams played great. Jake and Tam flowed seamlessly together, Jake went off big time holding nothing back and Skippy commented that he had never seen Tam play better. Taking 3rd place was the suprise team of Danny & Jeanie Cameranesi, who had been camping at Sequoia National Park and decided to drop by the tournament before heading back home. Danny hit several huge combos and Jeanie suprised everybody with her fluent, athletic style of play - she hit a big spinning gitis to end the routine. \r\n\r\nTaking 2nd was Tommy Leitner and Melissa Trail, hitting some nice sponteineous co-ops and air brushing runs, Melissa is playing with more confidence than ever. Winning the Mixed Pairs division was Skippy Jammer and Anne Graves, Anne played solid again and showed she has no fear of the water and Skippy....well, lets just say he was in the zone. \r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Co-op \r\n\r\n The final event was Open Co-op. In 5th place was the 4-some team of Carl, Anne, Mike Cloud and Melissa. They had some nice exchanges, Carl fired up to hit some mulitple spinning combos. The 4th place team of Tam, Mike and Johnny O were also a lot of fun to watch - and yes, JO did do another huge water catch! \r\n\r\nThe top 3 teams all shredded hard and the team of Pat, Jake and Dave Lewis had a legitimate shot at winning but a missed water gitis cost them valuable bonus points and they ended up 3rd. Dave totally went off hitting what seemed like every move in the book and Pat and Jake were in sync as well - it was awesome to see these guys shred together. Taking 2nd place was team Counter - Paul, Jamie and Danny. They hit almost everything they tried and put the pressure on. Tommy, Skippy and Deaton started slow and had to call a timeout because of music problems (beware of playing to live Doors because Jim Morrison has a tendency to stop a song and scold the crowd for making too much noise). But once the music went back on the team fired up and hit some big combos and co-ops including several triple spinning catches and water moves. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody for coming out! Hope to see you at Manpico this fall. \r\n\r\nSee ya at the beach! \r\n\r\n- Tom', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

I appreciate the kind words from Larry as well. First and foremost I want to thank Lawrence Frederick and the First coast Flying Disc Team (www.k9frisbee.com) for allowing The Jammers to trash all their hardware (tents tables and the like) and coming out to do some cool disc dog demos to start the tournament and draw spectators. Lawrence does this gratis even though the last few years he has been out of town during tourney weekend. Thanks also to J.T. Rosenthal who provided labor, tables and just being a go-to guy when needed. Larry Imperiale mentioned Carl Emerson as helping with the stereo. Carl also rented a truck so we could haul stuff, then he ends up doing the lion''s share of the effort to get things in place, torn down and cleaned.unbelievable. Also as Larry mentioned in his kind review, my extended family has rallied to elevate this weekend into a complete 24/7 experience (well maybe 24/5). Thanks Jeanine, Debbie, Cheryl. I also have a special atta-girl for the Tournament Mom, Pauline Kenny. She makes it a truly family experience. Although she claimed to be coming up to see me and share my joy, every time I turned around, she was hugging Murf.Hmmm. \r\n\r\nThe festivities got off to a wonderful start on Thursday for the TD as Toddy Brodeur took home the title of first jammer. TD and Toddy had an awesome jam under ideal conditions, light winds and low tides at Mikondo. Friday saw things elevate to a huge experience as most everyone showed up in time for a long Friday jam on the beach with again ideal winds and low tides. The view from the balcony of Mikondo as 4 or 5 mobups were going on was to die for. The stereo for the jams as well as the tournament was battery operated with a huge sound as three large boom boxes were linked together to provide a wall of sound. \r\n\r\nTournament Saturday saw again ideal conditions with low tide providing the perfect setting to incredible jamming. There were a number of highlights as the jamming went off and everyone played big. Three performances stand out from the tournament. First was the semifinal play of Tito Andino. He played HUGE. Double spinning this, big air that and hitting everything. TD has seen Tito before and along with everyone else was stunned by the incredible performance Tito displayed. The second performance was the coming out of first time competitor, our host Cheryl Kenny. Going out in mixed just to have fun with it, she turned in a performance that fired up the crowd. Mocking her partner with a bad attitude delay amongst other moves she carried the team to a stunning seed bust. Congratulations Cheryl!! The third highlight was the final round of Deaton Mitchell and Dave Murphy. With the theme "Jam By The Sea" (to the theme of Flipper), They call him Mur-Flipper, Mur-Flipper, faster than lightning, no one you see, can gitis like he.these guys turned in a magical performance. With one drop, and that was the last move triple planted gitis that was in Murf''s hand, these guys clearly separated themselves from their alleged competitors. Their play was built on big difficulty and clean play. I am not certain, but Deaton may have been dropless both rounds while not playing safely. Other highlights included Pipo and Anne putting on a mixed routine clinic to win and Larry and Joel''s final routine that took off the dust from their winning FPA Worlds routine. Congratulations to the winners and everyone else. The play was truly real and spectacular. \r\n\r\nSaturday night saw the first of the freestyle takeovers this group is famous for. The local Mexican restaurant offered the freestylers discounted dinner and drinks and the vultures pounced. Further mayhem ensued as the dance floor opened up and the freestylers took over. Dancing and hopping around all night, there might have been more sweat generated there than during the tourney. \r\n\r\nSunday saw more jamming in front of Mikondo, again the same conditions creating big jams again. Sunday night was the traditional Jammers party at Mi Casa with filet mignon on the grill and undocumented events in the Jacuzzi. Monday saw more jams as everyone decided they needed one last beach fix. The final jam was a death jam with Murf (jamming maybe 21 hrs over 4 days) and TD. Murf said he hit something like 8 moves he has never before hit including a 5 spin gitosis and a 6 or 7 spin something. The final crew of Gary, Carl, Michele Murf Cheryl and TD then enjoyed a last supper of sushi.and then the TD slept. \r\n\r\nA large collection of awesome photos will be made available in the next FPA Forum, the membership magazine. \r\n\r\nThanks to all for a wonderful time.we may have to do this again \r\n\r\nPaul Kenny', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Over 30,000 people attended this years AppleFest and many got a chance to see Freestyle Frisbee for the first time. Prelims took place Saturday between 4- 6pm as part of AppleFest Eve. The Village of Warwick gave the event a great location and alot of publicity--a full-page story on the front page of the sports section plus a couple of radio interviews. \r\n\r\nThe finals on Sunday were part of the entertainment for the AppleFest celebration. Large crowds got to see some great freestyle play as well as a quick instructional frisbee demo by Erwin Velasquez and Gary Auerbach. Spencer Bradley, from "Zen and the Art of Freestyle Frisbee" fame, was the MC of the event and kept things moving with his humor and knowledge of the game. He also provided those who slept over at the Barn a great breakfast of pancakes, scrambled eggs (folded, not stirred), thick bacon, sticky buns, and lots of coffee.\r\n\r\nThere were also a couple of frisbee dogs who entertained the crowd in between some of the routines. WCBQ radio station provided the sound system and Hannah Maxwell took care of the music. \r\n\r\nThe Freestyle Frisbee finals had $1,000.00 in prize money for the top 3 teams. Seven teams competed in the finals. The top 4 teams were so close that less than 1 point seperated all of them--the crowd got a great 90 minute show. Chris Ryan from Burlington, VT. showed up and although he said he hadn''t played in years, showed everyone that he still doesn''t suck. Paul & Mary Brenner also made it to the tournament and showed everyone that there not just great DDC players. \r\n\r\nI would also like to mention and thank all the sponsors who made this event possible.

It prooved to be one the best tournaments of the year, bringing together some of the top freestylers in the world to a location featuring perfect playing conditions. Tournament sponsors Patagonia and BIG, Inc. put on an excellent event with players from Colorado, Massachusetts, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Barbara, California coming out to play, party and compete. \r\nBeach Jam  \r\n\r\nSaturday the wind was strong and steady, you could basically do any wind move you could think of. Combine that with sunny weather and a minus low tide and what you get is premier beach freestyle conditions. There were no cuts on Saturday so the teams played loose without the worry of not making the finals. The result was real and spectacular! \r\n\r\nSunday morning the wind was dead and the thermometer hit 92 but later in the afternoon it kicked up and ended up being much stronger than Saturday. So, the teams were forced into survival mode at times with the wind blowing them back towards the peir. \r\n\r\nOpen Pairs Final \r\n\r\nJan Sobel and his son, Shane provided a nice alternative style of play throwing the disc high into the wind and having Shane go for big air and even a front flip into the water. Anne Graves and Alan Caplan worked the wind and hit some nice co-ops. Jamie Chantiles and Danny Cameranesi hit some big moves but had some trouble with the wind as did Larry Imperiale and Joel Rogers. Peter Laubert and Lee Harper were able to hit a good portion of their routine and had fewer drops than most teams which propelled them to a 4th place finish. \r\n\r\nThe top 3 teams all played great with Chip Bell/Danny Sullivan and Tommy Leitner/Dave Schiller tying for 2nd place. Chip and Danny shredded hard showing how years of beach jamming together really pays off - they hit legover body rolls, gitis pull outs and sweet sponteinous co-ops. Tommy and Dave hit some monster combos hitting lots of against moves and multiple spinning catches. The win went to the defending champs: Dave Lewis and Dave Murphy - they dealt with the gale force winds well with Dave L. hitting spinning phlauds and Dave M. going for big, acrobatic gitises. \r\n\r\nCo-op Final  \r\n\r\nIf 5 minute pairs wasn''t enough time to shred, then you could still look forward to 8 minutes co-op! Peter, Lee and Danny S. had won the pool the day before by hitting what seemed like everything they tried, but in the finals they had to try to make up for a flurry of drops in the openning minutes. Taking 3rd place was Joel, Jamie and Danny C. - these guys love the beach and it showed - Joel hit some nice scarecrow brushes and worked all sorts or cool angles with the disc, Jamie is playing really well these days catching big air on his spinning gitises, Danny C. played solid and spectacular as usual. \r\n\r\nDefending co-op champions, Tommy and Chip teamed with Larry Imperiale and after a slow start they turned up the heat with Chipper hitting a sweet 11 tip combo to the music, directly into a pull to a triple spinning catch. The routine ended with Chipper''s big water gitis. Team Dave cubed came out next and survived a few flat sections to shred their way to the title. They hit some cool, choreographed co-ops and big indys in the strong wind. Congraluations Dave...and Dave....and Dave! \r\n\r\nThe 2002 WBI rocked! \r\n\r\nThere were almost as many sideline jammers as competitors - Richi Smits, Richi Bartal, Crazy John Brooks, Z, Alex "Zen" Schwartz, Ami, Amy, Jeanie and local jammers Corey, John and Scott. On Sunday there was a school of fish close to shore and the Pelicans went crazy, you could see 10 Pelicans and Sea Gulls dive into the water at the same time, resulting in a frenzy of splashing and squaking. Thanks to Richi Bartal (BIG, Inc.) for bringing the sound system, to Patagonia for providing prizes and to Chipper "Bro" Bell, his family and staff....yes, the WBI 2002 rocked!!!', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This is the largest turn-out of jammers in the past two years. Also, there was a surprise appearance by Kate Dow who has been living in the Santa Fe New Mexico area for the past 9 years.

It was great seeing her play and we hope she will come out more often to jam with all of us in years to come!!! \r\n\r\nAlso, Deaton Mitchell was quite revved up to play and compete for this event, but was side-lined on Sat. after doing damage to his ankle.

The dynamics of so many countries and cultures meshing as one, with the love and friendship and jamming, I believe is the most wonderful, unique experience in the world. Remember all the love we shared with each other and never lose sight that love is the most powerful aspect of our community.\r\n\r\nAs I previously noted, with the tournament results comes a passing of the torch! In a stream of consciousness kind of way, I would like to go through many of the different facets I believe this entails.

I am amazed and am ready for this growth to continue.\r\n\r\nWith this torch passing comes a responsibility! I was struck by Iwan''s statement regarding the 90 percent of the support came from the US while 90 percent of the litter came from Europeans. I don''t really believe that but it put a thought in my mind. It is time for the Europeans to take more ownership of the sport. I believe you are ready! The FPA does not run smoothly just because a few folks are on the FPA Board. It runs smoothly when everyone in the FPA contributes. A tournament runs smoothly not because someone decides to be a tournament director. It runs smoothly because others are there to help out as needed...and in the case of bigger events, both before and after. It is critical the more time you spend in the sport, the more you give back. We are a small, grass-roots sports on the big stage. Our best hope for further growth is if everyone contributes in their own way. It is the little things that make the sport great. If everyone at a tournament helps out one time is a small way, the tournament is better. Help move a table, pick up someone else''s trash, help with judging, thank someone who is working hard. We are all volunteers, remember that. Lisa is not making anything running the FPA, Skippy made nothing running judging. It is the love of the sport that drives them. We need to thank those people who put forth the effort. At FPA''s I think of Lisa, Skippy, Bethany, Doug, Rodney as perhaps the most visible and deserving of all the praise we can muster, but there were many more that helped and deserve thanks as well. I also think of Iwan, Renee, Frank, Michael and other locals that worked their butts off. All that effort, for the love of the sport and for all of us, is to be admired. It should be mimicked by all of us.\r\n\r\nWhat each of us individually does in public is observed and the sport is many times judged by passersby based on this behavior. If someone sees a shredding move, they say WOW, what a great sport. If they see someone leave garbage on the ground, the whole sport is perceived to be as second rate. If they see a big event, well organized, they will come back. This happens when everyone helps out. If they see a disorganized event they won''t come back. That happens when folks wait for others to do the work.\r\n\r\nWe are truly at a crossroads in the sport in so many special ways. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for all of us. We are ready to be great and explode. The big time is right around the corner. We are very fortunate to have this opportunity available to us. It likely will not happen again.\r\n\r\nThe keys to the kingdom are yours...Look in the mirror. What do you think of the future of the sport when you look?\r\n\r\nIt looks bright to me!!\r\n\r\nCarpe Diem\r\n\r\nPK\r\n\r\nFreestyle\r\nReveals\r\nImagination\r\nSpirit\r\nBeauty and\r\nEmotional\r\nExpression', 'y', 'www.amsterjam.nl', 'info@freestyle-frisbee.nl', 'Intl', 'n'),

Not only are there many new players but the overall level of existing players has skyrocketed since last years worlds in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 freestylers were in attendance at the event which used 3 US judges - Jake Gauthier, Lori Daniels and me - allowing the players to have more time to jam and work on routines. The Championships also had 2 Italian players - Fabio Sanna and Matteo Feller join in...although their teams were not eligible to become German freestyle champs if they had won.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the weather was very hot as was the freestyle and 24 open pairs competed in the prelims. The event took place at a wonderful sportcenter similar to the one where the worlds were held in Berlin last year. There was a gym available for free sleeping accomodation, a restaurant and a beer garden all a short frisbee throws distance from the jam field.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the weather turned windy and a bit rainy so we moved the pairs semi indoors and later decided to do all the finals there as well since a decent crowd had gathered and the energy and crowd noise in the gym was so high. Some highlights of the co-op final were local favorites Rainer, Domy and Jochen playing very well - with Domy going for the Mikey Ried style big air and Rainer hitting some incredible kick passes. It was great to see the multi-national team of Bianca from Berlin, Matteo from Milan and Ot from Thailand hook up and have a nice spontaneous jam.\r\n\r\nHarmut, Bo and Enrique (from Dortmund and Cologne) had some nice co-ops but a few too many drops to challenge for the title placing 5th. Berlin-stylers Philipp, Anton and Markus Hein had a very solid round placing 4th. In 3rd place Heiko, Markus Goetz and Fabio showed a very cool, choregraphed routine which fired up the crowd earning them 3rd place. Daniel, Kolja and Jan were one of the first teams to play and got so hot they almost won the division...All three of these jammers have improved by leaps and bounds this year.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last team in the co-op round took the floor and the anticipation was very high as the Karlsruhe based trio of Flo, Christian and Carsten - who were also the event organizers began their routine. They hit co-op after co-op and indy after indy and at one point Christian set up Carsten for a big flying gitis that hit off Carsten''s leg - alertly Flo dove head long on the floor to catch the disc to huge ovation from the crowd. By the time they hit their last co-op the crowd had worked istelf into a frenzy. They made it easy for the judges as they hit the routine of the tournament and won the co-op final. I overheard their new team name is going to be the Karlsu-radicals.\r\n\r\nIn the pairs final Philipp and Markus H. and Fabio and Matteo tied for 4th place just behind Kolja and Carsten who redeemed themselves after a lack luster semis performance placing 3rd in the finals. Daniel and Bianca totally shredded hitting one of the best routines of the weekend placing 2nd. Once again the top seed came through as the last routine of the event, featuring Bo and Hartmut came onto the floor decked out in suits and ties. They hit their well choreographed routine with very few errors and won the German Freestyle Championship pairs division for the 3rd consecutive year. Hartmut was last seen drinking Hefeweisen out of the 1 meter high trophy - I hope he made it home ok ;-)\r\n\r\nThe finals also featured a mixed pairs demo which allowed some local girls who are playing really well to show their stuff - Watch out for Judith and Julia in Amsterdam!\r\n\r\nThere was also a judges jam, dog demos and gymnastics and cheerleading demos to keep the crowd interested between rounds.\r\n\r\nSee photos here\r\n\r\nSee a short video here\r\n\r\nCongratulations to all the winners and to everybody who took part in Karlsruhe, and a special big thanks to Flo, Carsten and Christian and their staff on working so hard to make this event happen!\r\n\r\nDanke, danke, danke! später bis in Amsterdam!!!\r\n\r\n- Tom', 'y', 'freestylefrisbee.de', 'DM07@jamngo.com', 'Intl', 'n'),

Only 1.73 difference between first and last.\r\nLast one in was Bram but he sure gets my vote for Spirit of the game! \r\nThe routine for local Bram was hard. He was ''alone''.

The little change was that the non competing players at the moment scored each phrase verbally and the average was wrote as the score.

Forlì is an acient city, founded in 188 BC and it''s the birthplace of the famous Renaissance painter, Melozzo da Forlì who was one of the most outstanding fresco painters of the 15th century.\r\n\r\nThe ''1st Grand Prix'' event was held indoors in a very big gym with a high quality sound system ...Claudio, Marco and Matteo did a lion''s share of the work but had lots of help from friends and family as well.  A fairly decent crowd came out for the finals as well - I guess it doesn''t hurt to offer free beer and paninis to the audience. ;-)  They did a wonderful job coordinating their first event and the posters, t-shirts and trophies were all very well done...\r\n\r\nThe event had a very relaxed, non-competitive feel to it and it was great to see so many new players.  Claudio Cigna''s girlfriend, Ilaria Aprile has really improved along with the other local Forli-an jammers especially Marco and Gloria.  It was also great to see Andrea Dini return to action and he and partner Matteo Gaddoni put on quite a show in the finals hitting a nicely choreographed routine and earning 2nd place.  Luca Medri and Marco Prati also had an excellent round but theirs came in the semi-finals.  One of the bigger suprises was the team of Matteo Ceresa and Alessandro Berra who came within a few points of winning the b-final.  But the Torino team was edged out by Andrea "Alli" Poli and Riccardo Sanna who executed very well though Matteo, Ale and fellow Torino native Jazz took home a special spirit award given by the staff.  Clay Collera'' and Claudio Cigna took the title with big moves, nice co-ops and very few errors.\r\n\r\nIn co-op Claudio and Clay won again this time with Luca Medri, performing a ''spider man'' routine featuring numerous big air catches and 3 disc work. In 2nd was the spontaneous jam by Matteo Gaddoni, Danilo Torzolini and Tom Leitner (me) - we had some nice indys and flow but also had some drops.  Many players played great - of course we all know about Fabio, Clay, Gaddoz and Claudio but players like Valerio ''Wall'' Occorsio, Paolo ''Paolosis'' Magni, Luca, Danilo, Andrea Dini, Marco "Cega" Prati, Riccardo Sanna (no relation) and Andrea "Alli" Poli are all improving very fast.  And Silvia Caruso showed she''s been practicing her clock game as she jammed effortlessly with clock players in the open division - and only getting a single counter throw in one round didn''t seem to bother her at all.\r\n\r\nIn the mixed division, Gloria and Clay almost upset the Italian champs Ele and Fabio as they hit most of their co-ops and combos, but Fabiosis and Ele were once again up to the task and were able to execute well enough to win.  Though only 4 women competed - 3 other new fem-jammers were playing on the sidelines. (Marty, Ilaria and Arianna)\r\n\r\nCongratulations to all the winners (including Matteo who won the ''spirit of the jam'') and a big thanks to the staff and the locals who made us feel like very welcome guests.

Not that I was victorious in PR, \r\nbut I did have a super time. It''s now my son''s school winter break, so \r\nhere we are. I want to share some thoughts of my first visit to a \r\nPuerto Rico Jam.\r\n\r\nIn late January, it had been raining in California since Christmas and \r\nI was beginning to feel housebound, unable to get out and jam on the \r\nwet ground. So I got the bug to travel to Pipo''s Winter Jam event. I \r\ncontacted him about a bed at the Pipo lodge and he set one aside for \r\nme. My reservations were made the same day and the anticipation set in.\r\n\r\nIt wasn''t until the weekend before PRWJ, that it stopped raining \r\nenough for me to get in some beach jam practice at Dillon Beach with \r\nTam and Mike Esterbrook. So I felt pretty rusty when I arrived in San \r\nJuan. After eight hours of air travel from the left coast, I was \r\npicked up Wednesday evening at the airport by Pipo and Toddy Brodeur, \r\nwho''d gotten in the day before. We made a stop at the grocery store \r\nfor supplies, the gas station for gas and scoped out a flat and hard- \r\npacked beach in the dark for the next day''s play. We started to notice \r\na frequent pattern of people on the streets and stores greeting Pipo, \r\neverywhere we went. Hanging with Pipo is like hanging with a Hollywood \r\ncelebrity. Everybody knows and loves Pipo!\r\n\r\nPost-midnight we found ourselves at a night club with a Latin singer. \r\nPipo recommended a Puerto Rican rum special. I''m not a big alcohol \r\nconsumer and was going to get an iced tea, but I decided to simplify \r\nour order and make it three Pipo specials. We watched as the bartender \r\nseemed to be crushing sugar and many unknown ingredients with a mortar \r\nand pestle and finally adding the rum. It turned out to be tasty, \r\nindeed. Pipo ordered a burger unfamiliar to us, while Todd and I \r\nordered a safe Amercano burger. Toddy was going to order french fries, \r\nbut that wasn''t part of Pipo''s lean-n-mean diet. Pipo suggested fried \r\nyuca instead and we consented easily. The burgers hit the late night \r\nhunger spot, the yuca was fabulous and we kept wanting more every \r\nfollowing night. It was at that time, Toddy pointed out that one \r\nshould always take the Pipo recommendation and you''ll never go wrong. \r\nI quickly adopted that attitude.\r\n\r\nThere had already been a beach jam the day I arrived, which produced \r\nthe footage for the PRWJ Valentine which Pipo composed and edited the \r\nnext morning. It''s at <http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=nYmxDmEBbLU>, in \r\ncase you missed it. Let me point out that the sound you hear in that \r\nvideo is not the surf and waves, its the WIND!\r\n\r\nThursday afternoon when we arrived at the beach, I was stunned by the \r\nwind. In Puerto Rico, it''s all about the wind! I have a simple wind \r\nmeter that is standard equipment in my freestyle bag. I was able to \r\ngage how Puerto Rico winds matched up to California and other stylin'' \r\nsites. It was the strongest wind I''ve ever played in. In California, \r\nI would usually give at these wind speeds. But here it is expected. \r\nThe base windspeed all weekend, as read on my meter, was 12MPH and up, \r\ngusting up to 15-18. I never saw anything of 20MPH though, at least \r\nby my meter.\r\n\r\nThere were already Puerto Rican jammers playing when we arrived, PR \r\nplayers are amazing having no trouble handling the strong wind. They \r\nkeep their bodies wet and the disc wet too. They guide and slide the \r\ndisc all over all parts of their bodies, arms, legs, and backs. Pretty \r\ncool. They''re power brusher jammers and play well in these conditions. \r\nThey had a game like I''d never seen in my 30 years of play. I was very \r\nhumbled by them.\r\n\r\nOld-time 80-molds and Hi-Rig discs were the discs of choice for their \r\nslight extra weight. I grew up on these so that was comfortable. But \r\nin no time at all I was able to get the disc to fly backwards over my \r\nhead and land 30-40 feet away. Nobody laughed, but I was feeling like \r\na beginner. Watching Pipo and the locals, I quickly learned that a \r\nflat wind angle was necessary. But once you attained that angle the \r\ndisc would float in the air beautifully. Pipo was doing 3-4 spins to \r\nevery kind of catch you could imagine. I watched as much as I played \r\nthe first day.\r\n\r\nI observed all the players that were new to me. Tito Mex is an eye- \r\ncatcher. The way he guides the disc up and down his arms, around his \r\nback is a sight to see. He has a unique skill. Coqui (cookie) is an \r\nintense air brusher and powers into turbo rolls from his brushes. He \r\nputs roll sequences together in the wind, like on one else. But the \r\nmost fun part of playing near him when he rolls and brushes, is the \r\nlittle "whooo" sound he makes as the disc slides across him. It \r\ndefinitely brings out a smile in those nearby. Bostonian "Pops" \r\nScannell is closing in on 60 and still pulling off his trademark \r\nmoves. Being a veteran of past Puerto Rican jams, Steve knew how to \r\nhandle the winds. Anne Goh was playing very well, holding her own with \r\nthe guys in the winds. Her skills are ever improving.\r\n\r\nPipo was making regular trips to the airport bringing in new arrivals. \r\nAlfonso Lopez from Columbia, South America arrived and jumped in with \r\nwhat were now two jams of 3-5 people. At 1.91 meters, Alfonso has a \r\nhuge reach and doesn''t let the disc get over his head. I quickly found \r\nthat playing clean-up, behind him was an unfruitful proposition. Not \r\nmuch gets by him. Alfonso was stretching his skills and quickly \r\nfigured out how to play these winds. Late in the day, recent Jam Camp \r\ngraduate Geoff Gregory from Orlando, arrived at the beach after a day \r\nat work in PR. Geoff arranged a sales trip to PR to coincide with the \r\nWinter Jam. Nice job. Geoff is a solid, go-got-it player who nabs a \r\nlot of good catches and seemed to have experience in these winds too. \r\nPipo''s childhood friend, Tito Andino, arrived from Florida late. We \r\nplayed until dark, as we did every day.\r\n\r\nPipo took several of us to a pleasant restaurant with outdoor seating \r\nwhere everyone enjoyed some excellent food and drink. Pipo''s beautiful \r\ngirlfriend, Jeanie joined us after work, just as we were finishing up \r\ndinner. Alfonso, Geoff, Toddy, Jeanie and eventually Tito all went \r\nback to Pipo''s place where we gathered in the Z-machine room. This a \r\nwell-lit, open room with rubberized mats on the floor and the stated \r\ndevice in the corner for practice. We indulged in Z-machine challenges \r\nas well as lessons in difficult moves from Toddy. This went on for 2-3 \r\nhours until we were all sweaty again and was late again. Afterwards we \r\ncooled down watching freestyle videos until 3-4AM\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning, Tito Andino, who stayed up late with everyone that \r\nnight before, was really feeling ill. We departed for the beach that \r\nday with him still laid up in bed, with what turned out to be a 24 \r\nillness. This day we went to the beach near our sponsor hotel. One \r\ninteresting feature of this hotel was that they had four poster beds \r\nand hammocks on the beach, that you could lounge in and have drinks \r\nserved. The wind was roaring as usual. More new faces appeared at the \r\nbeach. Lilianna Cruz from San Juan, joined with Toddy and Anne in the \r\nfirst jam of the day. Lili is obviously a regular wind jammer, who has \r\nno trouble brushing, rolling and passing with the best of the locals. \r\nShe''s a welcome addition to anybody''s beach jam. Lili''s presence was \r\ntempered with visits to the hospital to be with her ailing mother. \r\nThoughts of her mom, who had bypass surgery on Monday, were were with \r\neverybody all weekend. Jams broke out with Pops and Alfonso, and later \r\nToddy, Anne Tito Mex, and Pipo. Geoff Gregory showed up after work \r\nagain. His wife Nanette (also Jam Camp grad) and mother-in-law flew in \r\nto PR to join us for a quick vacation. Tito Andino appeared late in \r\nthe day, having been nursed back to health by Pipo, to indicate that \r\nhe was feeling better again. My play was gradually improving as I \r\nstruggled to deal with the wind. At the end of the day, we relaxed at \r\na restaurant right across the street from the beach hotel. Pipo and \r\nJeanie then took us out for a walk through a typical Puerto Rico \r\nFriday night multi-block street party. There was live music, drinks \r\nand throngs on people mingling on the streets. Puerto Ricans find \r\nevery reason to party that they can.\r\n\r\nSaturday there were new faces at the beach again. I met Emmanuel (?), \r\nour tournament videographer, . He happens to be a big Apple Computer \r\nfan, so I hit it off with him immediately. Alan Martinez from the \r\nnearby Dominican Republic was now with us. Ricardo "Ricky" Guzman is \r\nanother new avid jammer, working on all his hot moves. Ah, the speed \r\nof youth. He joined the early jam with Pops, Pipo and Tito Andino, who \r\nwas now back among the living. Sunday was chosen to be competition day \r\nso that Lili could be with us, so Saturday was the last day to work \r\nout your wind game. By now, every time when I headed from beach rest \r\nspot to beach jam spot, my attitude was that of going to do battle \r\nwith or fight the wind. It was challenging, but after a few days, I \r\nwas getting it. A second jam formed with Toddy, Tito Mex and Anne. \r\nJeanie showed that she''d learned to jam in the wind while hanging \r\naround Pipo, and I joined with her and Alfonso in a third jam. Later \r\nin the day, I think the winds actually dropped down to 10-12 MPH and I \r\nwas almost playing my regular beach game at last. Evening dinner was a \r\nlarge gathering for Mofungo, a Puerto Rican plantain, and choice of \r\nseafood or chicken.\r\n\r\nSunday was official competition day. Seven teams were formed and \r\nplayed in "whenever your ready" order. We cordoned off a section of \r\nbeach to play on and to protect the players and care-less beach \r\nwalkers from each other. Jeanie kept a four minute time watch for each \r\nteam, and I''ll bet all seven teams played consecutively in about 30 \r\nminutes. Great format, no judging pressure or shuffling. There was a \r\nshort mob-op competition of two teams, Americans vs. Caribbeans, again \r\nfour minutes per team, 5-6 players per team. The general opinion was \r\nCaribbeans won this easily, playing clean and surpassing the Americans \r\nin catches. Pipo had a friend with a long lens digital still camera \r\ncome and take pictures as well. He liked to focus on player facial \r\nexpressions as well as the disc play. His pictures of people showed an \r\namazingly interesting viewpoint, that I''d never seen before on player \r\nfaces. I was amazed by my expressions and how similar they were to \r\nthose of others, showing extreme concentration. We grabbed some quick \r\nMexican food and brew before heading to Pipo''s to change for the \r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning up and dressing for a party evening, Pipo played the \r\nvideo from the day and the house guests judged the play from the day. \r\nThe odd thing was that this was the first time, I''d ever judged myself \r\nin a tournament. All judges were faced with the same prospect and \r\nimpartially had to count their own drops and evaluate their moves. \r\nPipo collected the judges sheets and tallied up the scores. (Results \r\nwere sent in a separate posting by Pipo). We then headed out for some \r\nmajor dancing and partying at a San Juan hot spot. There was live \r\nmusic, with recorded music during band break. All genres of music were \r\nencountered. We camped out at great tables virtually on the dance \r\nfloor. Everybody danced and everybody had fun. Even I downed a number \r\nof beers! We came within a song of closing the place down, before we \r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nMonday was a day of departure for some and another day of jamming for \r\nthose remaining. The Pipo taxi dropped off Toddy in the morning and \r\nlater Steve and Anne. Before heading to the beach that day, Pipo and I \r\nengaged in some geocaching activity. This is a hi-tech treasure hunt \r\ndriven by a handheld GPS receiver unit, used to locate hidden caches \r\nall around the world. (See http://www.geocachi ng.com). We had made a \r\nshort quick attempt to locate a San Juan cache near Pipo''s house on \r\nThursday but were unsuccessful. Armed with a new clue from the \r\nwebsite, we made another run at the cache after dropping off Todd and \r\nwere successful. The Monday afternoon jam was casual and relaxed, as \r\nby now I had learned how to survive in the wind. Pipo, Jeanie, \r\nAlfonso, Tito Mex and Coqui played until late afternoon. For the first \r\nday, we left before dark. Pipo, Jeanie, Alfonso and I headed to a \r\nBrazilian restaurant for a unique vegetarian pizza with salmon. Always \r\ngo with the Pipo recommendation!\r\n\r\nTuesday was my departure date. Pipo seemed to enjoying geocaching and \r\nsuggested we try for some more before dropping me at the airport. I \r\nset up my GPS unit with some new cache coordinates nearby in San Juan. \r\nAlfonso came with us. We took a walk through beautiful Millennium Park \r\nnear old San Juan. After a third of a mile hike from the parking lot \r\nto the north shore, we located this cache in the rocks at the \r\nshoreline. Another successful find. We ran into traffic and ran out of \r\ntime on the way to another cache site and decided to head for the \r\nairport.\r\n\r\nIn summary, it was a tournament I''ll remember forever. I never went to \r\nbed before 2AM. I played for five consecutive days without a straining \r\nanything. Pipo says muscle pulls are nonexistent since the wind and \r\nwater are 72-82 degrees. I got personal coaching from Toddy and Pipo. \r\nI loved that. I learned a lot and have new things to practice. I \r\nspent a bunch of time chatting with Toddy and Alfonso. We all spent a \r\ngood deal of our morning and late evening in the breezeway of Pipo''s \r\nabode, elevating our spirit with conversation and such. Being in the \r\ncompany of people who love to do what you love to do is a pleasure. \r\nWe''re all looking forward to the next time we can get together. Pipo \r\ntakes care of everybody and deals with the language barrier for the \r\nSpanish-challenged. Parties were great. Food was great. Pipo''s house \r\nand company were great. Even my tournament finish exceeded my \r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nThanks to Pipo, Jeanie and all Puerto Rican jammers who made this such \r\na special time. If you ever get the chance to attend a PRWJ, don''t \r\nhesitate.\r\n\r\nOne Happy Jammer,\r\nDoug Korns', 'y', '', 'batuman@prtc.net', 'US - East', 'n'),

Und bei gutem Wetter wollten die Nürnberger ihren eigentlichen Jamspot vorstellen – die Wöhrderwiese. Nach einem kurzen Nässecheck musste dennoch für den Jamspot bei der Brücke entschieden werden. \r\n\r\nDas Hat-Turnier sollte starten und die Paare wurden ausgelost. Insgesamt nahmen zwölf Spieler teil. Das Los entschied, dass jedes Team mindestens einen Nürnberger enthalten sollte. Die Zusammensetzungen sahen folgendermaßen aus:  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    * Olli mit Rainer\r\n    * Phill mit Markus\r\n    * Tob mit Flo\r\n    * Ot mit Freddy\r\n    * Dennis mit Niki\r\n    * Chris mit Nico \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDas Halbfinale konnte auf dem Fußballfeld gestartet werden. Vier Teams zeigten, was möglich war bei diesem stürmisch starken Wind. Nachdem vier Teams ihre drei Minuten gespielt hatten, fing es plötzlich wieder an, heftig zu regnen. Die gesamte Mannschaft flüchtete unter die Brücke. Bevor es dort weitergehen konnte, mussten wir uns zuerst ein bisschen mehr Platz freijammen. Wildes Brushen bei immer stärker werdendem Wind wies die Leute zurück, sodass wir wieder genug Platz hatten, das Turnier fortzusetzen.\r\n\r\nDie beiden letzten Teams mussten ihren Run unter schwierigsten Bedingungen durchführen. Der Wind riss die Scheibe selbst aus dem Centerdelay in die Höhe und kontrollierte Kombos waren fast unmöglich. Trotzdem kämpften sich die Teams Phill-Markus und Chris-Nico durch. Nur geringfügig konnten die erschwerten Bedingungen in der Kategorie Difficulty berücksichtigt werden. Trotz Allem schafften Phill und Markus es, den Pool zu gewinnen.\r\n\r\nAußer Phill und Markus qualifizierten sich noch fürs Finale knapp dahinter Ot und Freddy. Im Pool A gewann das Team Flo-Tob und als Zweiter erreichten Dennis und Niki das Finale. \r\n\r\nDer Regen war vorbei, die Sonne schien wieder und der ganz starke Wind beruhigte sich langsam. Das Finale konnte also wieder auf dem Fußballfeld ausgetragen werden. \r\n\r\nAlle Teams zeigten einen anspruchsvollen Run mit gekonnten Brushs, Spinning-Tricks und Jumping-Catchs. Die Stimmung war durchgehend gut; nicht zuletzt durch die sehr starke Begeisterung von Nico und den Nürnberger Newcomern, die aus dem Staunen gar nicht mehr rauskamen. \r\n\r\nMit einem grandiosen Run und super Moves gewann das Team Tob-Flo das Turnier mit 19,5 Punkten. Den zweiten Platz erkämpften sich Ot und Freddy mit 16,9 Punkten, die im Halbfinale noch hinter Phill und Markus platziert waren. Phill und Markus erreichten somit den dritten Platz knapp dahinter mit 16,0 Punkten. Das Team Dennis-Niki belegte den vierten Platz mit 11,8 Punkten. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDie Hundefrisbee-Show von Jule und Jochen rundete den Tag perfekt ab und es machte allen einfach nur Spaß, dabei zu sein.\r\n\r\nEine Veranstaltung, die allen einfach nur Spaß gemacht hat! Ein riesiges Dankeschön noch mal an Phill und Tob, die das Event super organisierten und mit Sicherheit in den nächsten Jahren wieder organisieren werden.', 'y', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Das Motto wurde inspiriert von der wunderschönen Günther-Klotz Anlage in der das Turnier stattfand. Die Teams wurden anhand des Zufallsprinzips aus einem Hut gezogen...\r\n\r\nUnd wie der Zufall so will, hatten wir zum einen das Glück, dass einige Teams in völlig neuer Konstellation zusammen spielen konnten, und zum Anderen das sich auch langjährige Partner erneut beweisen durften :-P\r\n\r\nDas Anfangs skeptisch betrachtete Wetter entwickelte sich prächtig an dem Wochenende. Nachdem die Freestyler am Freitag Abend noch gezwungen waren in die Sporthalle auszuweichen, wandelte es sich von Regen über, recht frischen Wolken-Mix zum strahlenden Sonnenschein.\r\nUm das Turnier für die 10 Teilnehmer so unstressig wie möglich zu gestallten, entschlossen wir die einzelnen Läufe auf Video aufzuzeichnen und am Abend nach dem DFB-Pokal Finalspiel auf Großleinwand zu bewerten. Die Idee erweiß sich als perfekt! Im Schwarzen Schaf bekamen wir ein rundum Sorglospaket mit gutem Essen, ausreichend erheiterten Getränken, Life Musik, und dem obligatorischen Kickerturnier, dass das „Prosecco Team“ Jaqueline und Domi mit Abstand gewann!\r\n \r\n\r\nDas Video-Judging, bei dem jeder Spieler eine Note (von 0 bis 10) für den Gesamteindruck abgeben durfte ergab folgendes Ergebnis:\r\n \r\n1.  	Florian Hess / Christian Lamred 	67,0\r\n2. 	Mehrdad Hosseinian / Alexander Leist 	60,0\r\n3. 	Heiko Vogt / Robert Dittrich 	55,5\r\n4. 	Judith Haas / Lina Bödecker 	46,0\r\n5. 	Dominique Weißenberger / Jacqueline Hummel 	36,0\r\n\r\nAls sportliches Resümee kann man sagen, dass die durch den Hut gezogenen Teams sehr gut harmoniert haben, und unterhaltsame, abwechslungsreiche Routinen zeigten! Ein weiterer Beweis, dass das Level der deutschen Spieler in den letzten Jahren stark gestiegen ist. Das kooperative Verhalten im Jam war an diesem Wochenende ein Highlight für mich. Schon lange nicht mehr hatte ich soviel Spaß und großartige Zufallsmomente in einer 5 bis 8 Mann starken Gruppe!\r\n\r\n\r\nDer lange lustige Abend hatte zur Folge, dass wir nicht wie geplant am Sonntag eine zweite Runde spielen konnten, sondern uns voll unserer Lieblingsbeschäftigung dem „Jammen“ widmen durften. Zur Abrundung trafen wir uns diesmal an unserem Haupt Jamspot - dem Karlsruher Schlosspark , bei dem wir mit unsere aufgestellten Musikanlage und der neuen Beachflag für viel Aufmerksamkeit sorgten. So richtig angeheizt wurden die Jams mit Hailas brasilianischen Rhythmen, Pandeiro und Ukulelen Sounds!\r\n\r\nAls hätte es nicht passender kommen könnten trafen wir uns zum abschließenden gemeinsamen Abendessen in unserem Lieblings Mexikaner unter einem 2m Durchmesser großen HUT (Sombrero ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn dieser Stelle möchte ich mich noch mal bei den Teilnehmern bedanken, die teilweise eine sehr lange Anreise für unser kleines Turnier auf sich genommen haben und so richtig rangeklotzt haben!', 'y', 'www.discrockers.de/freestylefrisbee/freestyleevents/klotzenstattglot', 'Frisbee-Freestyler@gmx.de', 'Intl', 'n'),

Pairs/Hat style draw.', '', 'US', '', 'Photo-Video Link 1', '', 'Photo-Video Link 2', '', 'Photo-Video Link 3', '', 'Photo-Video Link 4', '', 'Photo-Video Link 5', '', '', '', 'Local', 'The 2013 version of Wintershred went down on a sunny, but very windy San Francisco day. The wind was so strong (20-25 mph, at least) that it blew us off the Beach and in to Golden Gate Park where we found a nice little spot to jam where there was actually very little wind. \r\n\r\nWe had an interesting turn out of Freestylers this year. Some new up and coming players and some surprise appearances from the past showed up and mixed it up for most of the afternoon. New to Wintershred and relatively new to Freestyle competition, was Johnny Trevino coming down with Mike Galloupe from Seattle. His energy and enthusiasm for the game energized the local crust for hours and hours. We also got a blast from the past when old school jammer John Barsky showed up with Keith Armstrong. It was the first time he had nailed up and played in 20 years. His jamming buddies from the early days were Krae Van Sickle and John Dwork back in the Big Apple for gosh sakes. He proved that he could still get it done, and that muscle and neural freestyle memory actually has a longer shelf life that you might expect. He dusted off some cool old school moves and a variety of especially crusty yet tasty ambidiscareous throws. I was often left trying to determine\r\nwhich spin was coming at me. Keith had been absent for awhile, as well, yet showed no loss of skill. Infact, after peeling out series after hein series I joked that he should take two years off more often.\r\n\r\nThe competition was a random draw pairs format performed at a ''compromised'' 3.5 minutes per routine. Bonus points were given for Gitis catches, Scarecrow Catches, and a foot brush to a partner''s catch. Depending on how hein the move was completed, 1-3 points were given. These points were added to an overall score of 1-10 points for a total score. \r\n\r\nFirst up was Seattle jammer and newly crowned World Mixed Pairs champion Mike Galloupe. He was teamed with local Bay Area Jammer Rick Moody. These guys played well with Mike providing big moves and hitting all the bonus point categories. Rick was mister consistency. After Mike''s early thunderous Gitis they did struggle a bit to get the scarecrow and foot brush and it may have cost them some on the overall score. They finished in third.\r\n\r\nNext up Doug Korns paired up with Johnny Trevino. These guys were on and hit their moves throughout, though the foot brush catch was eluding them for most of the routine. They got it near the end and got it good. Johnny hit multiple gitis, and some cool complex series, while Doug hit all his signature moves including a solid UD Crow. They finished in 1st place.\r\n\r\nThird up, the old master John Barsky teamed up with me (Carl Dobson) for fun jam on the grass. John was going all tasty old school moves, series and throws. I felt like I was jamming back in the 70''s again. Even our music was a remix of the old Byrds song ''8 Miles High''. I hit a quick spinning crow and then we picked off another bonus move when I kick brushed a long high pass to John. I thought for a second it was to high, but no problem John casually spun into a nice blind around the head seal. Just one gitis was left for a trifecta, but alas that proved elusive as I missed a couple tries. We finished in second.\r\n\r\nUp last was Mike Esterbrook and Keith Armstrong. These guys really played well with good flow, lots of passing and the highest scoring bonus move with Keith''s crash and burn double spinning gitis for 2.5 pts. They got a decent crow as well, but struggled with the kick brush and that may have brought them down a bit. They finished in 4th. \r\n\r\n1st- Johnny Trevino/Doug Korns: 35.25 pts.\r\n2nd- Carl Dobson/John Barsky: 34.75 pts.\r\n3rd- Mike Galloupe/Rick Moody: 30.5 pts.\r\n4th- Keith Armstrong/Mike Esterbrook: 27.75 pts.\r\n\r\nThe jamming was awesome all day, with a good vibe going all the while. Some of us kept it going until 5pm and flights had to be caught back to Seattle.\r\nHope some of you can make it to next years Wintershred. \r\n\r\nWith zzzz''s\r\n\r\nCarl', 'y', 'N/A', 'dobpic@sbcglobal.net', 'US - West', 'n'),
